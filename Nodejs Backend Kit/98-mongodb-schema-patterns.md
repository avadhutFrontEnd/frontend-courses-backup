## Why it matters

[Lesson 44](44-schema-design-amp-data-modeling.md) gives you two tools: embed the related data, or reference it by id. Real collections rarely fit either tool cleanly. A sensor writes one reading a minute for years, so embedding all of them in one document is impossible and one document per reading creates millions of tiny documents. A product page wants the three newest reviews, not all 40,000. A bestseller has a buyer list 1,000 times longer than a normal book.

The schema patterns are named, reusable answers to those shapes. Each one moves cost from one place to another: from reads to writes, from many small documents to fewer large ones, or from a join to a copy that can go stale. You choose a pattern by naming the read you want to make cheap and the cost you are willing to pay for it. In an interview, "I'd use the bucket pattern" is a weak answer. A strong one is "I'd bucket by sensor-hour, which cut the documents from 100,000 to 1,670 and the index from 2 MB to 68 KB, at the cost of an upsert per write".

## The concept, simply

Every pattern in this lesson sits somewhere between the two baselines from lesson 44. **Embedding** puts owned, bounded data inside the parent, so one read returns everything. **Referencing** keeps the data in a second collection and joins it at read time with `populate()` or `$lookup`. The patterns are compromises between the two: embed *some* of it (subset, extended reference), embed a *summary* of it (computed), group many small things into a few medium documents (bucket), or treat the rare huge case differently from the common small one (outlier).

![Embedding vs referencing: an order with items nested inside it, read in one query, versus an order holding a userId that points into a separate users collection and is joined at read time](assets/i41_01_7b178f88.svg)
*Figure: the two baselines every schema pattern trades between. Look at: "One read gets everything" on the embed side versus "Needs populate / $lookup" on the reference side.*

| Pattern | Problem it solves | Read it makes cheap | What it costs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bucket | Millions of tiny documents (time series, events) | "All readings for sensor S in this range" | Upsert logic on write; a bucket is the unit you read and update |
| Subset | A large array where only the first few items are read often | The page that shows the top N | Two writes per item; the subset is a duplicate |
| Computed | The same aggregate recomputed on every read | A count, sum or average | Extra write per change; drift if a write is missed |
| Extended reference | A join on every read for a few stable fields | A list screen that shows the related name | Copies go stale until you fan the change out |
| Outlier | A few documents are far larger than the rest | The common case stays one read | Extra code path and a second query for outliers |
| Polymorphic | Different shapes that are queried together | One query across all types | Validation and indexes must handle absent fields |
| Tree: parent ref | Hierarchies where you mostly move or list children | Direct children | Subtree needs recursion (`$graphLookup`) |
| Tree: materialized path | Hierarchies where you read whole subtrees | A subtree, as one prefix scan | Moving a node rewrites every descendant |

## How it works

How to choose a pattern, in order:

1. **Write down the hot reads**, with their filter and sort. For example, "one sensor, one day, ordered by time" or "the product page with its 3 newest reviews".
2. **Write down the writes and how often they happen:** a reading a minute, a review a day, a customer rename once a year.
3. **Start from the baseline** that lesson 44 gives you: embed if the data is owned and bounded, reference if not.
4. **Find the cost that hurts.** The document count is too high, a document is too large, a join runs on every read, or an aggregate runs on every read.
5. **Pick the pattern that moves that cost** onto something rarer, usually the write path.
6. **Measure both shapes** with `$collStats` (sizes and counts) and `explain('executionStats')` (keys and documents examined), as the examples below do.
7. **Write down the new invariant.** Examples: "`recentReviews` holds at most 3 entries", "`ratingSum` equals the sum of `ratings.stars`", "`customer.name` on an order may lag the customer by one fan-out job". The pattern is only correct while that invariant holds.

**Bucket.** One document holds a group of related small items: all readings for one sensor in one hour, plus summary fields such as `count` and `sum`. Writes become an upsert that `$push`es into the open bucket. The filter includes `count: { $lt: N }` so that a full bucket stops matching and the upsert starts a new one. Reads fetch a handful of buckets instead of thousands of documents. The index has one entry per bucket instead of one per reading, which is where most of the space saving in Example 1 comes from. Each document also carries its own `_id` and field names, so fewer documents means fewer repeated bytes. MongoDB's *time series collections* (added in 5.0) do this bucketing for you inside the server. If your data is measurements over time, read [the time series docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/timeseries-collections/) before you build buckets by hand.

**Subset.** The parent embeds only the part of a large related set that the hot read shows: the newest 3 reviews, the top 10 comments. The full set lives in its own collection. `$push` with `$each`, `$position: 0` and `$slice: N` keeps the embedded array at exactly N entries in one atomic update, so the document cannot grow without bound. The cost is two writes per new item and a duplicate of the newest items.

**Computed.** Store the result of a calculation (`ratingCount`, `ratingSum`, a running total) and update it with `$inc` on each write. Reads no longer scan the detail rows. The invariant is that the stored values equal what an aggregation would return. A write path that forgets the `$inc`, or crashes between the two writes, breaks it. Use a transaction (see [lesson 47](47-transactions-amp-acid.md); it needs a replica set) or a periodic recompute job if exactness matters.

**Extended reference.** Instead of only `customerId`, the order stores `{ _id, name, city }`, which are the few fields the order list shows. The full customer stays in `customers`. You gain a join-free list screen. The cost is *staleness*: a rename updates `customers` but not the copies, until you run `updateMany` on every order that references the customer. Copy only fields that change rarely, and decide whether the order *should* keep the old value. A shipping address on an order is often meant to be a snapshot.

**Outlier.** Design for the common case: embed buyers in the book, capped at a limit you choose. When a document hits the cap, set a flag (`hasOverflow: true`) and write the extra items into overflow documents in another collection. Readers check the flag and query the overflow only when it is set. The common case keeps its single read. The rare case pays for a second query and an extra code path that you have to test.

**Polymorphic.** Documents with different shapes share one collection because they are queried together: "everything under $50" across books, shirts and ebooks. A shared `type` field tells the shapes apart (Mongoose calls this a *discriminator*, see [lesson 43](43-mongodb-amp-mongoose.md)). Shared fields get normal indexes. Type-specific fields get *partial* indexes filtered on `type`, so that, for example, `isbn` is unique among books without forcing shirts to have one ([lesson 99](99-mongodb-indexes-in-depth.md)).

**Trees.** There are four common shapes, and they trade write cost for read cost:

- **Parent references.** Each node stores `parent`. Listing direct children is one indexed equality query, and moving a node changes one document. A whole subtree needs `$graphLookup`, which runs a recursive search on the server.
- **Child references.** Each node stores a `children` array. Listing children is fast, but the parent's array has to be kept in sync with the children. It is not shown below.
- **Array of ancestors.** Each node stores `ancestors: ['Books', 'Programming']`. A subtree is an equality match on a multikey index, and a breadcrumb is already in the document.
- **Materialized path.** Each node stores a string such as `,Books,Programming,Databases,`. A subtree is an *anchored* regex prefix `^,Books,Programming,`, which the index turns into a key range scan. Sorting by `path` gives depth-first order. Moving a node rewrites the path of every descendant.

**What "anchored" buys you.** For a regex that starts with `^` and has no case-insensitive flag, the query planner converts the literal prefix into index bounds. In Example 7 the bounds are `[",Books,Programming,", ",Books,Programming-")`; `-` is the character after `,` in ASCII. So only the keys inside that range are examined. Any other regex still uses the index, but it has to test every key (Example 8).

## Code examples

Each example is a standalone ES module. Run it with `MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:<port>/ node file.mjs` after `npm install mongodb@7.7.0`, against MongoDB 8.2.6 run locally via mongodb-memory-server's downloaded mongod binary (no Docker). Each script drops and recreates its own database.

**Example 1 — bucket vs one document per reading, measured with `$collStats` and `explain`.** There are 100,000 readings (10 sensors × 10,000 minutes), stored once as one document per reading and once as sensor-hour buckets. `fsync` forces a WiredTiger checkpoint so the on-disk sizes reflect the data just written. `scale: 1024` reports sizes in KB.

javascript

```
// bucket.mjs — one document per reading vs one document per sensor-hour
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGO_URL ?? 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:6301/');
const db = client.db('patterns_bucket');
await db.dropDatabase();

const SENSORS = 10, MINUTES = 10_000;          // 10 sensors × 10,000 minutes = 100,000 readings
const t0 = Date.UTC(2026, 0, 1);
const flat = [], buckets = new Map();
for (let s = 0; s < SENSORS; s++) {
  for (let m = 0; m < MINUTES; m++) {
    const ts = new Date(t0 + m * 60_000);
    const value = 20 + ((s * 7 + m) % 50) / 10;
    flat.push({ sensorId: s, ts, value });
    const hour = new Date(Math.floor(ts / 3_600_000) * 3_600_000);
    const key = `${s}|${+hour}`;
    if (!buckets.has(key)) buckets.set(key, { sensorId: s, start: hour, count: 0, sum: 0, readings: [] });
    const b = buckets.get(key);
    b.readings.push({ ts, value }); b.count++; b.sum += value;   // computed fields kept beside the bucket
  }
}
await db.collection('readings').insertMany(flat);
await db.collection('readings').createIndex({ sensorId: 1, ts: 1 });
await db.collection('reading_buckets').insertMany([...buckets.values()]);
await db.collection('reading_buckets').createIndex({ sensorId: 1, start: 1 });

await db.admin().command({ fsync: 1 });        // force a checkpoint so the on-disk sizes are current
for (const name of ['readings', 'reading_buckets']) {
  const [st] = await db.collection(name).aggregate([{ $collStats: { storageStats: { scale: 1024 } } }]).toArray();
  const s = st.storageStats;
  console.log(name.padEnd(16), `docs=${s.count}`, `dataKB=${s.size}`, `storageKB=${s.storageSize}`,
    `indexKB=${s.totalIndexSize}`, s.indexSizes);
}

// The read both shapes serve: one sensor, one day (1,440 readings)
const from = new Date(t0 + 2 * 86_400_000), to = new Date(+from + 86_400_000);
const e1 = await db.collection('readings').find({ sensorId: 3, ts: { $gte: from, $lt: to } })
  .explain('executionStats');
const e2 = await db.collection('reading_buckets').find({ sensorId: 3, start: { $gte: from, $lt: to } })
  .explain('executionStats');
for (const [name, e] of [['readings', e1], ['reading_buckets', e2]]) {
  const x = e.executionStats;
  console.log(name.padEnd(16), `returned=${x.nReturned} keys=${x.totalKeysExamined} docs=${x.totalDocsExamined}`);
}

// Writing one new reading into the bucket shape: upsert into the open bucket for that hour
const ts = new Date(t0 + MINUTES * 60_000), hour = new Date(Math.floor(ts / 3_600_000) * 3_600_000);
const r = await db.collection('reading_buckets').updateOne(
  { sensorId: 3, start: hour, count: { $lt: 60 } },
  { $push: { readings: { ts, value: 21.5 } }, $inc: { count: 1, sum: 21.5 } },
  { upsert: true });
console.log('bucket write:', { matched: r.matchedCount, modified: r.modifiedCount, upserted: r.upsertedCount });
await client.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, mongodb 7.7.0, MongoDB 8.2.6):
//   readings         docs=100000 dataKB=6113 storageKB=2148 indexKB=2072 { _id_: 976, sensorId_1_ts_1: 1096 }
//   reading_buckets  docs=1670 dataKB=3601 storageKB=1528 indexKB=68 { _id_: 32, sensorId_1_start_1: 36 }
//   readings         returned=1440 keys=1440 docs=1440
//   reading_buckets  returned=24 keys=24 docs=24
//   bucket write: { matched: 1, modified: 1, upserted: 0 }
```

What the numbers say:

- **Documents:** 100,000 → 1,670 (60× fewer).
- **Index size:** 2,072 KB → 68 KB. There is one key per bucket instead of one per reading, so the `_id` index and the compound index shrink by the same factor.
- **Data size:** 6,113 KB → 3,601 KB uncompressed BSON. That is less than half the saving because the reading values still have to be stored. What disappears is the per-document `_id` and the repeated `sensorId` field. On disk (compressed) the change is 2,148 KB → 1,528 KB.
- **The day query:** it examines 24 index keys and 24 documents instead of 1,440 of each. It returns 24 buckets, and the application (or an `$unwind`) flattens them.
- **The cost** is in the write path: every reading is an upsert with a filter on `count`, not a plain insert. Reading a single minute means fetching its whole bucket.

Storage sizes move by a few KB between runs, because they depend on when WiredTiger compacts its pages. The document counts and the keys examined are exact.

**Example 2 — subset: the newest 3 reviews embedded, all reviews in their own collection.**

javascript

```
// subset.mjs — keep the 3 newest reviews on the product, all reviews in their own collection
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGO_URL ?? 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:6301/');
const db = client.db('patterns_subset');
await db.dropDatabase();
const products = db.collection('products'), reviews = db.collection('reviews');
await reviews.createIndex({ productId: 1, at: -1 });
await products.insertOne({ _id: 'p1', name: 'Kettle', price: 39, recentReviews: [], reviewCount: 0 });

async function addReview(productId, review) {
  await reviews.insertOne({ productId, ...review });           // write 1: the full history
  await products.updateOne({ _id: productId }, {                // write 2: the embedded subset
    $push: { recentReviews: { $each: [review], $position: 0, $slice: 3 } },
    $inc: { reviewCount: 1 },
  });
}
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  await addReview('p1', { by: `user${i}`, stars: (i % 5) + 1, text: `review ${i}`, at: new Date(Date.UTC(2026, 9, i)) });
}

// Product page: one read, bounded size
console.log(await products.findOne({ _id: 'p1' }, { projection: { _id: 0, name: 1, reviewCount: 1, 'recentReviews.by': 1 } }));
// "See all reviews" page: the second collection, paged by the index
console.log((await reviews.find({ productId: 'p1' }).sort({ at: -1 }).skip(3).limit(3).toArray()).map(r => r.by));
await client.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, mongodb 7.7.0, MongoDB 8.2.6):
//   {
//     name: 'Kettle',
//     recentReviews: [ { by: 'user5' }, { by: 'user4' }, { by: 'user3' } ],
//     reviewCount: 5
//   }
//   [ 'user2', 'user1' ]
```

`$slice: 3` runs after `$position: 0` puts the new review first, so the array never holds more than 3 entries. The "all reviews" page reads `reviews` through the `{ productId: 1, at: -1 }` index. It skips the 3 that are already embedded and shows `user2` and `user1`.

**Example 3 — computed: store `ratingCount` and `ratingSum` instead of aggregating 20,000 ratings per read.**

javascript

```
// computed.mjs — compute the average once per write instead of once per read
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGO_URL ?? 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:6301/');
const db = client.db('patterns_computed');
await db.dropDatabase();
const ratings = db.collection('ratings'), movies = db.collection('movies');
await ratings.createIndex({ movieId: 1 });

const docs = Array.from({ length: 20_000 }, (_, i) => ({ movieId: 'm1', stars: (i % 5) + 1 }));
await ratings.insertMany(docs);
// Computed fields: maintained by $inc on every rating write
await movies.insertOne({ _id: 'm1', title: 'Arrival', ratingCount: 20_000, ratingSum: docs.reduce((s, d) => s + d.stars, 0) });

// Read path A: aggregate on every page view
const a = await ratings.aggregate([{ $match: { movieId: 'm1' } }, { $group: { _id: null, avg: { $avg: '$stars' } } }])
  .explain('executionStats');
const stA = a.stages?.[0]?.$cursor?.executionStats ?? a.executionStats;
const [{ avg }] = await ratings.aggregate([{ $match: { movieId: 'm1' } }, { $group: { _id: null, avg: { $avg: '$stars' } } }]).toArray();
console.log('aggregate per read: avg =', avg, '| keys examined =', stA.totalKeysExamined, '| docs examined =', stA.totalDocsExamined);

// Read path B: read the precomputed fields
const e = await movies.find({ _id: 'm1' }).explain('executionStats');
const m = await movies.findOne({ _id: 'm1' });
console.log('computed field:     avg =', m.ratingSum / m.ratingCount, '| keys examined =', e.executionStats.totalKeysExamined, '| docs examined =', e.executionStats.totalDocsExamined);

// The write cost: every new rating is two writes
await ratings.insertOne({ movieId: 'm1', stars: 5 });
await movies.updateOne({ _id: 'm1' }, { $inc: { ratingCount: 1, ratingSum: 5 } });
console.log(await movies.findOne({ _id: 'm1' }, { projection: { _id: 0, ratingCount: 1, ratingSum: 1 } }));
await client.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, mongodb 7.7.0, MongoDB 8.2.6):
//   aggregate per read: avg = 3 | keys examined = 20000 | docs examined = 20000
//   computed field:     avg = 3 | keys examined = 1 | docs examined = 1
//   { ratingCount: 20001, ratingSum: 60005 }
```

The aggregation reads 20,000 index keys and 20,000 documents on every page view. The computed fields read 1 of each. The price is the second write in the last block. If the process dies between the two writes, `ratingCount` is off by one until something recomputes it.

**Example 4 — extended reference: a join-free order list, and the staleness it costs.**

javascript

```
// extref.mjs — copy the few customer fields an order screen needs into each order
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGO_URL ?? 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:6301/');
const db = client.db('patterns_extref');
await db.dropDatabase();
const customers = db.collection('customers'), orders = db.collection('orders');
await orders.createIndex({ 'customer._id': 1 });

await customers.insertOne({ _id: 'c1', name: 'Ada Lovelace', city: 'London', email: 'ada@example.com', phone: '…', loyalty: { tier: 'gold' } });
const ada = await customers.findOne({ _id: 'c1' });
await orders.insertMany([1, 2, 3].map(n => ({
  _id: `o${n}`, total: n * 10,
  customer: { _id: ada._id, name: ada.name, city: ada.city },   // the extended reference
})));

// Order list: one query, no $lookup
console.log(await orders.find({}, { projection: { _id: 1, 'customer.name': 1 } }).toArray());

// The cost: the copy goes stale until you fan the change out
await customers.updateOne({ _id: 'c1' }, { $set: { name: 'Ada King' } });
console.log('after rename, order says:', (await orders.findOne({ _id: 'o1' })).customer.name);
const r = await orders.updateMany({ 'customer._id': 'c1' }, { $set: { 'customer.name': 'Ada King' } });
console.log('fan-out update:', { matched: r.matchedCount, modified: r.modifiedCount });
console.log('now order says:', (await orders.findOne({ _id: 'o1' })).customer.name);
await client.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, mongodb 7.7.0, MongoDB 8.2.6):
//   [
//     { _id: 'o1', customer: { name: 'Ada Lovelace' } },
//     { _id: 'o2', customer: { name: 'Ada Lovelace' } },
//     { _id: 'o3', customer: { name: 'Ada Lovelace' } }
//   ]
//   after rename, order says: Ada Lovelace
//   fan-out update: { matched: 3, modified: 3 }
//   now order says: Ada King
```

Between the rename and the `updateMany`, every order shows the old name. The fan-out touches every order that references the customer, which is 3 here. For a customer with 50,000 orders, a rename is 50,000 document writes, so the `{ 'customer._id': 1 }` index is what keeps that update from scanning the whole collection.

**Example 5 — outlier: cap the embedded array, overflow the rare huge case.**

javascript

```
// outlier.mjs — most books have a few buyers; one bestseller has thousands
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGO_URL ?? 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:6301/');
const db = client.db('patterns_outlier');
await db.dropDatabase();
const books = db.collection('books'), overflow = db.collection('book_buyers_overflow');
await overflow.createIndex({ bookId: 1 });
const CAP = 1000;   // the array limit you choose for the main document

await books.insertOne({ _id: 'b-normal', title: 'Niche Book', buyers: ['u1', 'u2', 'u3'] });
await books.insertOne({ _id: 'b-hit', title: 'Bestseller', buyers: [], hasOverflow: false });

async function addBuyer(bookId, userId) {
  // Try the main document first, only while the array is below the cap
  const r = await books.updateOne({ _id: bookId, [`buyers.${CAP - 1}`]: { $exists: false } },
                                  { $push: { buyers: userId } });
  if (r.modifiedCount === 1) return 'main';
  // Full: flag the outlier and write to an overflow document
  await books.updateOne({ _id: bookId }, { $set: { hasOverflow: true } });
  await overflow.updateOne({ bookId, count: { $lt: CAP } },
                           { $push: { buyers: userId }, $inc: { count: 1 } }, { upsert: true });
  return 'overflow';
}
const where = { main: 0, overflow: 0 };
for (let i = 0; i < 2500; i++) where[await addBuyer('b-hit', `u${i}`)]++;
console.log('writes landed in:', where);

// The common case pays nothing extra: one read
const normal = await books.findOne({ _id: 'b-normal' });
console.log(normal.title, 'buyers:', normal.buyers.length, 'hasOverflow:', normal.hasOverflow ?? false);
// Only the outlier needs the second query
const hit = await books.findOne({ _id: 'b-hit' });
let total = hit.buyers.length;
if (hit.hasOverflow) for await (const o of overflow.find({ bookId: 'b-hit' })) total += o.buyers.length;
console.log(hit.title, 'main array:', hit.buyers.length, 'overflow docs:', await overflow.countDocuments({ bookId: 'b-hit' }), 'total buyers:', total);
await client.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, mongodb 7.7.0, MongoDB 8.2.6):
//   writes landed in: { main: 1000, overflow: 1500 }
//   Niche Book buyers: 3 hasOverflow: false
//   Bestseller main array: 1000 overflow docs: 2 total buyers: 2500
```

The filter `'buyers.999': { $exists: false }` matches only while the array has fewer than 1,000 entries, so the check and the push happen in one atomic update. The niche book never sets `hasOverflow` and is read with one query. Only the bestseller needs the second query, which reads 2 overflow documents of up to 1,000 buyers each.

**Example 6 — polymorphic: three shapes in one collection, with a partial unique index for one type.**

javascript

```
// poly.mjs — one collection, several shapes, one shared "type" field
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGO_URL ?? 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:6301/');
const db = client.db('patterns_poly');
await db.dropDatabase();
const items = db.collection('catalog');
await items.createIndex({ type: 1, price: 1 });
await items.createIndex({ isbn: 1 }, { unique: true, partialFilterExpression: { type: 'book' } });

await items.insertMany([
  { type: 'book',  name: 'SICP',         price: 45, isbn: '978-0262510875', pages: 657 },
  { type: 'book',  name: 'TAOCP Vol 1',  price: 80, isbn: '978-0201896831', pages: 672 },
  { type: 'shirt', name: 'Logo tee',     price: 20, sizes: ['S', 'M', 'L'], color: 'black' },
  { type: 'ebook', name: 'Node Streams', price: 15, formats: ['epub', 'pdf'], fileMB: 4 },
]);

// One query across every shape, using only the shared fields
console.log(await items.find({ price: { $lt: 50 } }, { projection: { _id: 0, type: 1, name: 1, price: 1 } }).sort({ price: 1 }).toArray());
// Shape-specific fields are just absent on the other types
console.log(await items.find({ type: 'book', pages: { $gt: 660 } }, { projection: { _id: 0, name: 1, pages: 1 } }).toArray());
// The partial unique index only constrains books; shirts have no isbn at all
try { await items.insertOne({ type: 'book', name: 'dupe', price: 1, isbn: '978-0262510875' }); }
catch (e) { console.log('duplicate isbn:', e.code, e.message.split(' dup key')[0]); }
await client.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, mongodb 7.7.0, MongoDB 8.2.6):

```

The price query spans all types because `price` is a shared field. `pages` exists only on books, and the other documents simply do not match. The unique index on `isbn` has `partialFilterExpression: { type: 'book' }`, so it enforces uniqueness for books and contains no entries for shirts or ebooks.

**Example 7 — trees: parent references with `$graphLookup`, materialized path with an indexed prefix regex, array of ancestors.** The tree is small, so 20,000 unrelated categories are added to show that the prefix scan skips them.

import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGO_URL ?? 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:6301/');
const db = client.db('patterns_tree');
await db.dropDatabase();
const cats = db.collection('categories');
await cats.createIndex({ parent: 1 });
await cats.createIndex({ path: 1 });

// Books > Programming > {Databases, JavaScript > Node}, Books > Fiction
const nodes = [
  ['Books', null], ['Programming', 'Books'], ['Fiction', 'Books'],
  ['Databases', 'Programming'], ['JavaScript', 'Programming'], ['Node', 'JavaScript'],
];
const pathOf = {};
for (const [name, parent] of nodes) {
  pathOf[name] = parent ? `${pathOf[parent]}${name},` : `,${name},`;
  await cats.insertOne({ _id: name, parent, path: pathOf[name], ancestors: parent ? [...(pathOf[parent].split(',').filter(Boolean))] : [] });
}
// Padding: 20,000 unrelated categories so the index has something to skip
await cats.insertMany(Array.from({ length: 20_000 }, (_, i) => ({ _id: `x${i}`, parent: 'Other', path: `,Other,x${i},`, ancestors: ['Other'] })));

// Parent references: direct children is one indexed equality query
console.log('children of Programming:', (await cats.find({ parent: 'Programming' }).toArray()).map(c => c._id));
// ...but the whole subtree needs a recursive $graphLookup
const [sub] = await cats.aggregate([
  { $match: { _id: 'Programming' } },
  { $graphLookup: { from: 'categories', startWith: '$_id', connectFromField: '_id', connectToField: 'parent', as: 'desc' } },
]).toArray();

await client.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, mongodb 7.7.0, MongoDB 8.2.6):

```

The plan is an `IXSCAN` on `path_1` with bounds `[",Books,Programming,", ",Books,Programming-")`. It examined 5 keys (4 matches plus the first key past the range) and fetched 4 documents, even though the collection has 20,006 documents. The regex subtree includes `Programming` itself because its path matches the prefix. The `$graphLookup` and `ancestors` queries return only the descendants.

**Example 8 — edge case: which regexes the path index can serve, and what moving a subtree costs.** Only an anchored, case-sensitive prefix becomes a tight range. Moving a node rewrites every descendant's path.

javascript

```
// tree-edge.mjs — which regexes the path index can serve, and what moving a subtree costs
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGO_URL ?? 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:6301/');

await db.dropDatabase();
const cats = db.collection('categories');
await cats.createIndex({ path: 1 });
await cats.insertMany([
  ',Books,', ',Books,Programming,', ',Books,Programming,Databases,',
  ',Books,Programming,JavaScript,', ',Books,Programming,JavaScript,Node,', ',Books,Fiction,',
].map(path => ({ path })));
await cats.insertMany(Array.from({ length: 20_000 }, (_, i) => ({ path: `,Other,x${i},` })));

for (const re of [/^,Books,Programming,/, /Programming,/, /^,books,programming,/i]) {
  const e = await cats.find({ path: re }).explain('executionStats');
  const s = e.executionStats;
  console.log(String(re).padEnd(24), 'returned', s.nReturned, '| keys examined', s.totalKeysExamined);
}

// Moving JavaScript (and everything under it) from Programming to Books rewrites every descendant
const oldPrefix = ',Books,Programming,JavaScript,', newPrefix = ',Books,JavaScript,';
const r = await cats.updateMany(
  { path: { $regex: '^' + oldPrefix } },
  [{ $set: { path: { $concat: [newPrefix, { $substrCP: ['$path', oldPrefix.length, { $strLenCP: '$path' }] }] } } }],
);
console.log('move subtree:', { matched: r.matchedCount, modified: r.modifiedCount });
console.log((await cats.find({ path: /^,Books,/ }).sort({ path: 1 }).toArray()).map(c => c.path));
await client.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, mongodb 7.7.0, MongoDB 8.2.6):
//   /^,Books,Programming,/   returned 4 | keys examined 5
//   /Programming,/           returned 4 | keys examined 20006

//   move subtree: { matched: 2, modified: 2 }
//   [

//     ',Books,JavaScript,',
//     ',Books,JavaScript,Node,',
//     ',Books,Programming,',
//     ',Books,Programming,Databases,'
//   ]
```

All three regexes return the same 4 documents. The anchored one examines 5 index keys. The unanchored `/Programming,/` and the case-insensitive `/i` versions both examine all 20,006 keys: they still walk the index, but they test every key against the regex. The fix for case is to store the path in one case, not to add `/i`. The move is a single pipeline `updateMany` that rewrites 2 documents here. In a real catalog, moving a top-level node rewrites every document under it. Node names that contain regex metacharacters (`.`, `+`, `(`) must be escaped before you build the prefix pattern.

## Common mistakes & gotchas

- **Bucketing without a cap in the filter.** An upsert on `{ sensorId, start }` alone keeps pushing into one document forever. Include `count: { $lt: N }`, or bound the bucket by time so it cannot exceed N entries.
- **Treating a bucket as a row.** The day query in Example 1 returns 24 documents, not 1,440 readings. Code that expects one result per reading has to `$unwind` or flatten.
- **Subset with `$push` but no `$slice`.** The "recent" array then grows without bound, which is the anti-pattern the subset was meant to fix.
- **Computed fields updated outside the write path.** If one service `$inc`s and another inserts directly, the totals drift without any error. Put both writes behind one function, use a transaction when the total must be exact, or schedule a recompute.
- **Extended reference to volatile fields.** Copying `lastLoginAt` or a stock level means a fan-out on every change. Copy only fields that change rarely, and know which collection is the source of truth.
- **Forgetting the index that the fan-out needs.** `updateMany({ 'customer._id': id })` without an index on `customer._id` scans the whole orders collection.
- **Outlier logic that only some writers know about.** A writer that `$push`es directly bypasses the cap. Route every write through the same function.
- **Unanchored or case-insensitive path regexes.** They examine every key (Example 8). Anchor with `^` and normalise case when you write the path.
- **Paths without delimiters at both ends.** `/^,Books,Prog/` also matches `,Books,Programming,` and `,Books,Prognosis,`. End the prefix with the delimiter, as in `^,Books,Programming,`.
- **Polymorphic collection with a full unique index on a type-only field.** A plain unique index on `isbn` indexes every shirt as `isbn: null`, so a second document without an `isbn` collides. Use a partial index filtered on `type`.

## Best practices

- **Name the read first.** Each pattern is justified by one query that it makes cheaper. Write that query down, with `explain('executionStats')`, before and after.
- **Measure with `$collStats` and `explain`,** not by intuition: document count, `size`, `totalIndexSize`, `totalKeysExamined` and `totalDocsExamined`.
- **Use time series collections for measurements over time** before you build buckets by hand. Hand-built buckets are for groupings the server does not know about, such as "all events of one order".
- **Bound every embedded array** with `$slice`, a count in the filter, or a cap plus overflow.
- **Keep each pattern's invariant in one place:** one function writes the detail and the summary, or the detail and the subset.
- **Plan the fan-out for every copy:** which job updates it, which index the job uses, and how stale the copy may be.
- **For trees, pick the shape by the most common operation.** Use parent references if moves are common, a materialized path or an ancestors array if subtree reads are common, and both if you need both. Each extra shape is another field to keep in sync.

## ⭐ Interview lens

> **Q: “We store one document per IoT reading and the collection has 2 billion documents. What would you change?”**  
> A: Bucket by device and time window, for example one document per device-hour with `count`, `sum`, `min` and `max` beside the readings, or use a time series collection, which does this in the server. In my measurement, 100,000 readings went from 100,000 documents and a 2 MB index to 1,670 documents and a 68 KB index, and a one-day query went from 1,440 documents examined to 24. The cost is an upsert with a `count < N` filter on each write, and the read returns buckets that you flatten. *Trap:* claiming bucketing shrinks the data by 60×. The reading values still have to be stored, so only the per-document overhead and index entries shrink.

> **Q: “How do you show the 3 newest reviews on a product page without loading all of them?”**  
> A: Use the subset pattern. Store every review in `reviews` with an index on `{ productId, at: -1 }`, and embed the newest 3 in the product with `$push: { recentReviews: { $each: [r], $position: 0, $slice: 3 } }`. The page is one read. The cost is two writes per review and a duplicate of the 3 newest.

> **Q: “What goes wrong with the extended reference pattern?”**  
> A: The copied fields go stale. After the source changes, every copy shows the old value until a fan-out `updateMany` runs, and that update needs an index on the reference field. Copy only fields that rarely change, decide whether some copies are meant as snapshots (an address on a shipped order), and make one job responsible for the fan-out.

> **Q: “Parent references or materialized paths for a category tree?”**  
> A: Parent references make moves cheap (one document) and children cheap (an indexed equality query), but a subtree needs a recursive `$graphLookup`. A materialized path makes a subtree one index range scan through an anchored prefix regex, but moving a node rewrites every descendant. If subtree reads dominate and moves are rare, use paths, often together with `parent`. *Trap:* a case-insensitive or unanchored regex examines every index key, so the path index no longer narrows the scan.

## Cheat-card

- **Bucket:** many small items → one doc per group; upsert with `count: { $lt: N }`; measured 100,000 → 1,670 docs, index 2,072 KB → 68 KB.
- **Time series collections** (added in 5.0) bucket inside the server; prefer them for measurements over time.
- **Subset:** `$push: { arr: { $each: [x], $position: 0, $slice: N } }` + full collection; two writes per item.
- **Computed:** `$inc` totals on write; reads examine 1 doc instead of N; drift if a write is missed.
- **Extended reference:** copy `{ _id, name }` of the related doc; stale until `updateMany` fan-out; index the copied `_id`.
- **Outlier:** cap the array (`'arr.999': { $exists: false }` in the filter), flag `hasOverflow`, read overflow only when flagged.
- **Polymorphic:** shared `type` field; partial indexes for type-only fields.
- **Trees:** parent ref (cheap moves, `$graphLookup` for subtrees), ancestors array (multikey equality), materialized path (anchored `^prefix,` = index range; moves rewrite descendants).
- **Regex + index:** only an anchored, case-sensitive prefix gets tight bounds; `/x/` and `/^x/i` examine every key.
- **Measure:** `aggregate([{ $collStats: { storageStats: {} } }])` and `explain('executionStats')`.
