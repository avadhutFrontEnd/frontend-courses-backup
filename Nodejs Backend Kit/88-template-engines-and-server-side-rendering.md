## Why it matters

Lessons 34–42 build Express apps that answer with JSON. Plenty of Express apps answer with HTML instead: admin panels, account pages, docs sites, order-confirmation emails, the login form in front of an API. Building that HTML by gluing strings together in a route handler breaks quickly. You forget to escape one value, and a user named `<script>…</script>` runs code in every visitor's browser.

A template engine fixes the gluing, and Express has a fixed protocol for plugging one in: `res.render()`, `app.engine()` and the `views`, `view engine` and `view cache` settings. If you don't know that protocol, you hit these problems:

- **"Failed to lookup view" in production only.** The `views` setting defaults to `process.cwd() + '/views'`, so starting the app from another directory breaks every page.
- **Templates that never update.** `view cache` turns itself on when `NODE_ENV=production`, so an edited template is not picked up until you restart the process (Example 5). One engine version even ignores the per-render switch (Example 6).
- **XSS through a template that "escapes everything".** HTML escaping protects text between tags. It does nothing for a `javascript:` URL in an `href` or a value pasted into a `<script>` (Example 4).
- **User input steering the engine.** Some local names are engine options. Spreading `req.query` into the locals lets a visitor pick which layout file is read (Example 8).

This lesson covers the render protocol, the three engines you are most likely to meet (EJS, Pug, Handlebars) on one shared page, escaping and its limits, view caching, `res.locals`, and when an HTML response is a better fit than a JSON API.

## The concept, simply

A **template** is a text file of HTML with placeholders and a little control flow (loops, conditionals, includes). A **template engine** is a function that takes a template and a data object and returns the finished HTML string. Engines differ in syntax but share two jobs: replace placeholders with values, and **HTML-escape** those values by default (turn `<` into `&lt;`, `&` into `&amp;`, and so on) so data cannot become markup.

**Server-side rendering (SSR)** here means the classic kind: the server runs the engine for each request and sends a complete HTML page. (Frameworks such as Next.js also call it SSR when they render React components on the server; that is a different stack and not covered here.)

Express does not include an engine. It defines a contract and calls whatever engine you register:

- `app.set('views', dir)` says where template files live. It can be an array of directories.
- `app.set('view engine', 'ejs')` says which extension to assume when `res.render('home')` has none.
- An engine is a function `(filePath, options, callback)`. Express gets it from `app.engine(ext, fn)`, or, if nothing is registered for that extension, from `require(ext).__express`.
- `res.render(name, locals)` finds the file, calls the engine with the merged data, and sends the returned string with `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`.

The three engines in this lesson, all installed from npm:

| Engine | Package (version used) | Placeholder (escaped / raw) | Layouts | Partials |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EJS | `ejs` 7.0.1 | `<%= x %>` / `<%- x %>` | none built in: include a header and a footer | `<%- include('file', data) %>` (runtime) |
| Pug | `pug` 3.0.4 | `#{x}` or `p= x` / `!{x}` or `p!= x` | `extends layout` + `block content` | `include file` (compile time) |
| Handlebars | `express-handlebars` 9.0.2 (on `handlebars` 4.7.10) | `{{x}}` / `{{{x}}}` | `views/layouts/main.hbs` with `{{{body}}}` | `{{> name}}` from `views/partials/` |

EJS and Pug export `__express`, so Express loads them by extension with no `app.engine` call. express-handlebars does not, so you register it with `app.engine('hbs', engine({ extname: '.hbs' }))`. This lesson uses express-handlebars rather than `hbs` because its layout and partial directories are conventions you don't have to wire by hand.

## How it works

What happens on `res.render('guestbook', { title: 'Guestbook' })` in Express 5.3.0 (`lib/response.js`, `lib/application.js`, `lib/view.js`):

1. **`res.render` adds `res.locals`.** It stores `res.locals` as `options._locals` and supplies a default callback that calls `res.send(html)` on success or `next(err)` on failure.
2. **`app.render` merges the data.** `{ ...app.locals, ...res.locals, ...options }`, so a later source wins when the same key appears twice. `app.locals.settings` (the app settings object) is always included.
3. **It decides on caching.** If the merged object has no `cache` key, Express sets `cache = app.enabled('view cache')`. When `cache` is true and a `View` for this name is already stored in `app.cache`, steps 4–5 are skipped.
4. **It builds a `View`.** The extension comes from the name (`guestbook.pug`) or, if there is none, from the `view engine` setting. The engine function is `app.engines[ext]`, or `require(ext without the dot).__express` the first time (then stored). With no extension and no `view engine`, it throws `No default engine was specified and no extension was provided.`
5. **It looks up the file.** For each directory in `views`, in order, it tries `<dir>/<name><ext>` and then `<dir>/<name>/index<ext>`. If none exists, the error is `Failed to lookup view "guestbook" in views directory "…"`.
6. **It calls the engine.** `engine(filePath, mergedOptions, callback)`. The engine reads and compiles the file (or reuses its own compiled copy when `cache` is set), runs it with the data, and calls `callback(null, html)` or `callback(err)`.
7. **It sends the result.** Express 5 always delivers the callback asynchronously, even if the engine called it synchronously (changed in v5.0.0; Example 9). `res.send(html)` then sets `Content-Type`, `Content-Length` and an `ETag`.

No SVG in the kit shows this flow, so here it is as text:

```

**Two caches, not one.** `view cache` makes Express keep the `View` object (the resolved file path and engine) in `app.cache`, and it passes `cache: true` to the engine. The engine decides what that means. EJS, Pug and express-handlebars all keep compiled template functions in memory keyed by file path, so after the first render they stop reading the file. That is why an edited template is ignored in production until you restart (Example 5). The default is in `lib/application.js`: `if (env === 'production') this.enable('view cache')`, where `env` is `process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'`. The check is case-sensitive, so `NODE_ENV=PRODUCTION` leaves caching off. The same code is in Express 4.22.3.

**Layouts and partials.** A *layout* is the page frame (doctype, `<head>`, nav, footer) shared by every page. A *partial* is a fragment reused inside pages (one list row, a form field). Each engine does these differently:

- **EJS** has only `include`. `<%- include('partials/entry', { entry }) %>` runs the other file at render time, with paths relative to the current file. You use `<%-` (raw) so the included HTML is not escaped a second time. EJS has no layout inheritance, so the README's pattern is a `header` include at the top of each page and a `footer` include at the bottom.
- **Pug** has real inheritance. A page starts with `extends layout` and fills `block content`. `include partials/entry` pastes the other file in at **compile time**, so it sees the variables in scope where it is included (here the loop variable `entry`). For a fragment that takes arguments, Pug also has `mixin`.
- **express-handlebars** renders the page first and then renders the layout with the page HTML as `{{{body}}}`. The layout comes from `layoutsDir` (default `<views>/layouts/`) and `defaultLayout` (default `main`). Partials come from `partialsDir` (default `<views>/partials/`) and are used as `{{> entry}}`. A local named `layout` overrides the layout per render, and `layout: false` turns it off.

**What escaping does, exactly.** Escaped output replaces the characters that let text become markup. In the runs below, EJS replaces `& < > " '` (as `&amp; &lt; &gt; &#34; &#39;`). Handlebars also replaces `` ` `` and `=` (`&#x27;`, `&#x3D;`). Pug replaces only `& < > "`, so a single quote passes through. That is enough for text between tags and for an attribute value inside double quotes. It is **not** enough in three places, and Example 4 shows each one:

- **URL attributes** (`href`, `src`, `action`). `javascript:alert(1)` contains no character an escaper touches, and the browser runs it when the link is clicked. You need a scheme allowlist.
- **Unquoted attributes.** A space ends the attribute value, so `x onerror=alert(1)` adds a new `onerror` attribute. Always quote attributes.
- **Inside `<script>`.** The browser does not decode `&#39;` and similar entities in script text, so escaping is either useless (backticks, bare numbers, Pug's single quote) or corrupts the value. Put data into a script as JSON with `<` escaped, or in a `data-` attribute that the script reads.

**`res.locals` and `app.locals`.** `app.locals` is one object for the life of the app, merged into every render: the site name, helper functions, the asset base URL. `res.locals` is a fresh object for each request: the signed-in user, a CSRF token, flash messages. Middleware usually fills `res.locals` so that every template can read the values without each route passing them. Lesson [86 — Express app settings and locals](86-express-app-settings-and-locals.md) covers `app.locals` and `app.set` in detail. For rendering, remember the order: `app.locals` < `res.locals` < the object passed to `res.render`.

**Reserved names in the data.** The merged data object is also the engine's options object. Express reads `cache` from it. express-handlebars reads `layout`. Templates can read `settings` (all app settings, including `env` and `views`). The Express docs warn that the view name and the locals' keys "should not contain user-controlled input". Pass named values (`{ q: req.query.q }`), never a spread of `req.query` or `req.body` (Example 8).

**When SSR beats a JSON API.** No benchmarks were run for this lesson, so this comparison is about how each one works, not speed:

- *An HTML response is a complete document.* The browser can show it before any script loads, and it works with scripts disabled. Clients that don't run JavaScript can read it too: search crawlers that skip scripts, link-preview bots that read `<meta property="og:…">`, and email clients (render with `app.render` for emails).
- *A server-rendered app has fewer parts.* There is no client router, no client state store and no API versioning between your own front end and back end. A form `POST`s, the server redirects, and the next page is rendered. Escaping happens in one place, the engine.
- *JSON wins when there are several clients* (a mobile app, partners, a separate front end team that deploys on its own schedule), or when the page is an application whose state lives in the browser (editors, dashboards that update without page loads).
- *You can serve both from one route.* `res.format()` picks HTML or JSON from the `Accept` header (Example 10).

Measure before you pick for speed. Look at time to first byte and Largest Contentful Paint for your real pages, on your hosting, with your data.

## Code examples

Set up one folder for every example (the file names below are the names used in the commands):

bash

```
npm init -y
npm install express@5.3.0 ejs@7.0.1 pug@3.0.4 express-handlebars@9.0.2 supertest@7.3.1 parse5@8.0.1
npm install express4@npm:express@4.22.3 ejs6@npm:ejs@6.0.1   # only for the comparisons in Examples 6 and 9
```

Most examples drive the app with supertest (7.3.1), which starts the Express app on a random port and sends real HTTP requests to it. Examples 5, 6 and 10 call `app.listen()` and use `fetch` or `curl`.

**Example 1 — a custom engine: the `(filePath, options, callback)` contract and how Express finds the file.**

javascript

```
// engine.cjs: a 15-line template engine. {{key}} is HTML-escaped, {{{key}}} is raw.
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const express = require('express');
const request = require('supertest');

const esc = (s) => String(s).replace(/[&<>"']/g, (c) =>
  ({ '&': '&amp;', '<': '&lt;', '>': '&gt;', '"': '&quot;', "'": '&#39;' })[c]);

function tplEngine(filePath, options, callback) {   // the contract Express calls
  console.log('engine got filePath:', path.relative(__dirname, filePath));
  console.log('engine got option keys:', Object.keys(options).join(', '));
  fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8', (err, src) => {
    if (err) return callback(err);                     // error -> next(err)
    const html = src
      .replace(/\{\{\{\s*(\w+)\s*\}\}\}/g, (_, k) => String(options[k] ?? ''))
      .replace(/\{\{\s*(\w+)\s*\}\}/g, (_, k) => esc(options[k] ?? ''));
    callback(null, html);                              // string -> res.send(html)
  });
}

fs.mkdirSync(path.join(__dirname, 'views'), { recursive: true });
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'views', 'hello.tpl'),
  '<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1><p>{{{note}}}</p>\n');

const app = express();
app.engine('tpl', tplEngine);                 // register for the .tpl extension
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'tpl');                // lets res.render('hello') omit .tpl
app.locals.site = 'Demo';
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.locals.user = 'ada';
  res.render('hello', { name: '<Ada>', note: '<i>raw</i>' });
});
app.get('/missing', (req, res) => res.render('nope'));
app.get('/notinstalled', (req, res) => res.render('page.liquid')); // require('liquid')
app.get('/notengine', (req, res) => res.render('page.path'));       // require('path')
app.use((err, req, res, next) => res.status(500).send(err.message.split('\n')[0]));

(async () => {
  for (const url of ['/', '/missing', '/notinstalled', '/notengine']) {
    const r = await request(app).get(url);
    console.log(url, r.status, JSON.stringify(r.text.replace(__dirname, '<dir>')));
  }
})();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Express 5.3.0):
//   engine got filePath: views/hello.tpl
//   engine got option keys: settings, site, user, name, note, _locals, cache
//   / 200 "<h1>Hello &lt;Ada&gt;</h1><p><i>raw</i></p>\n"
//   /missing 500 "Failed to lookup view \"nope\" in views directory \"<dir>/views\""
//   /notinstalled 500 "Cannot find module 'liquid'"
//   /notengine 500 "Module \"path\" does not provide a view engine."
```

The option keys show the merge order: `settings` and `site` from `app.locals`, `user` from `res.locals`, `name` and `note` from the render call, then `_locals` and `cache` added by Express. `res.render('page.path')` really did `require('path')` and found no `__express`, which is why the view name must never come from the user. Express's `debug` output shows the file lookup (timestamps removed by the `sed`):

bash

```
$ DEBUG=express:view node engine.cjs 2>&1 | grep 'express:view' | sed "s#$PWD#.#; s/^[^ ]* //"
express:view lookup "hello.tpl"
express:view stat "./views/hello.tpl"
express:view render "./views/hello.tpl"
express:view lookup "nope.tpl"
express:view stat "./views/nope.tpl"
express:view stat "./views/nope/index.tpl"
express:view require "liquid"
express:view require "path"
```

**Example 2 — the same page in EJS, Pug and Handlebars: a layout, a partial, and a list with user input.**

Create these files (this listing is `tail` printing each file with its name):

bash

```
$ tail -n +1 views/ejs/guestbook.ejs views/ejs/partials/*.ejs
==> views/ejs/guestbook.ejs <==
<%- include('partials/header', { title }) -%>
<h1><%= title %></h1>
<ul>
<% for (const entry of entries) { -%>
<%- include('partials/entry', { entry }) -%>
<% } -%>
</ul>
<%- include('partials/footer') -%>

==> views/ejs/partials/entry.ejs <==
<li><b><%= entry.name %></b>: <%= entry.msg %></li>

==> views/ejs/partials/footer.ejs <==
<footer>Signed in as <%= user %></footer>
</body>
</html>

==> views/ejs/partials/header.ejs <==
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head><title><%= title %> · <%= siteName %></title></head>
<body>
$ tail -n +1 views/pug/layout.pug views/pug/guestbook.pug views/pug/partials/entry.pug
==> views/pug/layout.pug <==
doctype html
html
  head
    title #{title} · #{siteName}
  body
    block content
    footer Signed in as #{user}

==> views/pug/guestbook.pug <==
extends layout

block content
  h1= title
  ul
    each entry in entries
      include partials/entry

==> views/pug/partials/entry.pug <==
li
  b= entry.name
  | : #{entry.msg}
$ tail -n +1 views/hbs/layouts/main.hbs views/hbs/guestbook.hbs views/hbs/partials/entry.hbs
==> views/hbs/layouts/main.hbs <==
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head><title>{{title}} · {{siteName}}</title></head>
<body>
{{{body}}}
<footer>Signed in as {{user}}</footer>
</body>
</html>

==> views/hbs/guestbook.hbs <==
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<ul>
{{#each entries}}
{{> entry}}
{{/each}}
</ul>

==> views/hbs/partials/entry.hbs <==
<li><b>{{name}}</b>: {{msg}}</li>
```

The `-%>` in EJS removes the newline after a tag, so loops don't leave blank lines. One app per engine renders the same data:

javascript

```
// ssr.cjs: the same page, three engines, one Express 5 app per engine.
const path = require('node:path');
const express = require('express');
const { engine } = require('express-handlebars');
const request = require('supertest');

const data = {
  title: 'Guestbook',
  entries: [
    { name: 'Ada', msg: 'Hello from <b>bold</b> land' },
    { name: '<script>alert(1)</script>', msg: 'Tom & "Jerry"' },
  ],
};

function makeApp(kind) {
  const app = express();
  app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views', kind));
  if (kind === 'hbs') app.engine('hbs', engine({ extname: '.hbs' })); // ejs and pug load via __express
  app.set('view engine', kind);
  app.locals.siteName = 'Demo';                 // app-wide local
  app.use((req, res, next) => { res.locals.user = 'ada'; next(); }); // per-request local
  app.get('/', (req, res) => res.render('guestbook', data));
  return app;
}

(async () => {
  for (const kind of ['ejs', 'pug', 'hbs']) {
    const res = await request(makeApp(kind)).get('/');
    console.log(`--- ${kind}: ${res.status} ${res.headers['content-type']}`);
    console.log(res.text);
  }
})();
```

The real HTML each engine sent:

bash

```
$ node ssr.cjs
--- ejs: 200 text/html; charset=utf-8
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head><title>Guestbook · Demo</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Guestbook</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Ada</b>: Hello from &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; land</li>
<li><b>&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;</b>: Tom &amp; &#34;Jerry&#34;</li>
</ul>
<footer>Signed in as ada</footer>
</body>
</html>

--- pug: 200 text/html; charset=utf-8
<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Guestbook · Demo</title></head><body><h1>Guestbook</h1><ul><li><b>Ada</b>: Hello from &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; land</li><li><b>&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;</b>: Tom &amp; &quot;Jerry&quot;</li></ul><footer>Signed in as ada</footer></body></html>
--- hbs: 200 text/html; charset=utf-8
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head><title>Guestbook · Demo</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Guestbook</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Ada</b>: Hello from &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; land</li><li><b>&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;</b>: Tom &amp; &quot;Jerry&quot;</li></ul>
<footer>Signed in as ada</footer>
</body>
</html>
```

All three escaped the `<script>` name and the `<b>` in the message, so a browser shows them as text. They differ in whitespace (Pug writes no whitespace between tags unless you ask for it) and in the entity they use for `"` (`&#34;` vs `&quot;`, which a browser treats the same).

**Example 3 — escaped vs raw output, with a cookie-stealing payload.**

javascript

```
// escape.cjs: escaped vs raw output in each engine, rendered by Express 5 with one payload.
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const express = require('express');
const { engine } = require('express-handlebars');
const request = require('supertest');

const views = path.join(__dirname, 'views');
fs.mkdirSync(views, { recursive: true });
const templates = {
  'escaped.ejs': '<p><%= bio %></p>',
  'raw.ejs':     '<p><%- bio %></p>',
  'escaped.pug': 'p #{bio}',
  'raw.pug':     'p !{bio}',
  'escaped.hbs': '<p>{{bio}}</p>',
  'raw.hbs':     '<p>{{{bio}}}</p>',
};
for (const [file, src] of Object.entries(templates)) fs.writeFileSync(path.join(views, file), src);

const app = express();
app.set('views', views);
app.engine('hbs', engine({ extname: '.hbs', defaultLayout: false }));
const bio = `<script>fetch('/steal?c='+document.cookie)</script>`;
for (const file of Object.keys(templates)) {
  app.get('/' + file, (req, res) => res.render(file, { bio })); // fixed view name per route
}

(async () => {
  for (const file of Object.keys(templates)) {
    const r = await request(app).get('/' + file);
    console.log(file.padEnd(12), r.text);
  }
})();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Express 5.3.0):
//   escaped.ejs  <p>&lt;script&gt;fetch(&#39;/steal?c=&#39;+document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;</p>
//   raw.ejs      <p><script>fetch('/steal?c='+document.cookie)</script></p>
//   escaped.pug  <p>&lt;script&gt;fetch('/steal?c='+document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;</p>
//   raw.pug      <p><script>fetch('/steal?c='+document.cookie)</script></p>
//   escaped.hbs  <p>&lt;script&gt;fetch(&#x27;/steal?c&#x3D;&#x27;+document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;</p>
//   raw.hbs      <p><script>fetch('/steal?c='+document.cookie)</script></p>
```

The raw forms (`<%-`, `!{}`, `{{{ }}}`) pass the payload through untouched; in a browser it would send the visitor's cookies to `/steal`. Use them only for HTML you produced yourself (an include, a sanitised Markdown render), never for a user's value. Notice that Pug left the `'` unescaped; Example 4 shows where that matters.

**Example 4 — where HTML escaping is not enough: URL attributes, unquoted attributes and inline scripts.**

javascript

```
// contexts.cjs: HTML escaping is right for text between tags, and not enough anywhere else.
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const vm = require('node:vm');
const express = require('express');
const request = require('supertest');

const views = path.join(__dirname, 'views');
fs.mkdirSync(views, { recursive: true });
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(views, 'unsafe.ejs'), [
  '<a href="<%= website %>">website</a>',                 // 1. URL attribute
  '<img alt=<%= nick %>>',                                 // 2. unquoted attribute
  '<script>const greeting = `Hi <%= nick %>`;</script>',  // 3. template literal in a script
  '<script>const pageSize = <%= size %>;</script>',        // 4. bare value in a script
].join('\n'));
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(views, 'unsafe.pug'),
  "script.\n  const nick = '#{nick}';\n");                  // 5. Pug leaves ' unescaped
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(views, 'safe.ejs'), [
  '<a href="<%= httpUrl(website) %>">website</a>',
  '<img alt="<%= nick %>">',
  '<script>const greeting = <%- toScript("Hi " + nick) %>;</script>',
  '<script>const pageSize = <%= Number.parseInt(size, 10) || 20 %>;</script>',
].join('\n'));

```

There is no browser here, so the example checks what a browser would do in two ways. parse5 (8.0.1) implements the WHATWG HTML parsing algorithm, so its attribute list is the list a browser builds: the unquoted `alt` became four attributes, one of them `onerror`. Each `<script>` body runs in a `vm` context with a fake `alert`, which proves the attacker's code is now part of the script. In every unsafe case the escaper did its job, and the output is still exploitable, because the danger is in the *context*, not in `<` or `>`. The safe template fixes each context separately: a scheme allowlist for the URL, quotes around the attribute, `JSON.stringify` with `<` turned into `<` for script data (so a value cannot contain `</script>`), and a parsed number. Add a Content-Security-Policy header (lesson [52](52-web-security-owasp.md)) as a second layer.

**Example 5 — `view cache`: on only when `NODE_ENV` is exactly `production`, shown by editing templates between requests.**

javascript

```
// cache.cjs: does Express cache views? Run with different NODE_ENV values and edit templates between requests.
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const { once } = require('node:events');
const express = require('express');
const { engine } = require('express-handlebars');

const views = path.join(__dirname, 'views');
fs.mkdirSync(views, { recursive: true });
const write = (v) => {
  fs.writeFileSync(path.join(views, 'v.ejs'), `<p>ejs ${v}</p>`);
  fs.writeFileSync(path.join(views, 'v.pug'), `p pug ${v}`);
  fs.writeFileSync(path.join(views, 'v.hbs'), `<p>hbs ${v}</p>`);
};

const app = express();
app.set('views', views);
app.engine('hbs', engine({ extname: '.hbs', defaultLayout: false }));
app.get('/:ext', (req, res) => {
  if (!['ejs', 'pug', 'hbs'].includes(req.params.ext)) return res.sendStatus(404);
  res.render('v.' + req.params.ext);
});

(async () => {
  const server = app.listen(0);
  await once(server, 'listening');
  const base = `http://127.0.0.1:${server.address().port}`;
  const get = async () => (await Promise.all(['ejs', 'pug', 'hbs'].map(
    async (e) => (await fetch(`${base}/${e}`)).text()))).join(' ');

  write('v1'); const first = await get();
  write('v2'); const second = await get();          // template edited on disk between requests
  console.log(`NODE_ENV=${JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV)} env=${app.get('env')} ` +
    `view cache=${app.get('view cache')}\n  1st: ${first}\n  2nd: ${second}`);
  server.close();
})();
```

bash

```
$ node cache.cjs; for e in development test production PRODUCTION; do NODE_ENV=$e node cache.cjs; done
NODE_ENV=undefined env=development view cache=undefined
  1st: <p>ejs v1</p> <p>pug v1</p> <p>hbs v1</p>
  2nd: <p>ejs v2</p> <p>pug v2</p> <p>hbs v2</p>
NODE_ENV="development" env=development view cache=undefined
  1st: <p>ejs v1</p> <p>pug v1</p> <p>hbs v1</p>
  2nd: <p>ejs v2</p> <p>pug v2</p> <p>hbs v2</p>
NODE_ENV="test" env=test view cache=undefined
  1st: <p>ejs v1</p> <p>pug v1</p> <p>hbs v1</p>
  2nd: <p>ejs v2</p> <p>pug v2</p> <p>hbs v2</p>
NODE_ENV="production" env=production view cache=true
  1st: <p>ejs v1</p> <p>pug v1</p> <p>hbs v1</p>
  2nd: <p>ejs v1</p> <p>pug v1</p> <p>hbs v1</p>
NODE_ENV="PRODUCTION" env=PRODUCTION view cache=undefined
  1st: <p>ejs v1</p> <p>pug v1</p> <p>hbs v1</p>
  2nd: <p>ejs v2</p> <p>pug v2</p> <p>hbs v2</p>
```

Only the exact string `production` turns caching on, and then all three engines keep serving `v1` after the file says `v2`. The default is "undefined", not `false`, in every other environment, which `app.enabled('view cache')` treats as off. To force it either way, call `app.enable('view cache')` or `app.disable('view cache')` after creating the app.

**Example 6 — edge case: the per-render `cache` local is not honoured the same way by every engine.**

The Express docs say the local `cache` "is reserved for enabling view cache. Set it to true, if you want to cache view during development". Express does read it (step 3 above), but each engine decides for itself whether to cache compiled code:

javascript

```
// override.cjs: edge case, the per-render `cache` local is not honoured the same way by every engine.
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const { once } = require('node:events');
const express = require('express');
const { engine } = require('express-handlebars');

const views = path.join(__dirname, 'views2');
fs.mkdirSync(views, { recursive: true });
const write = (v) => {
  for (const [ext, src] of [['ejs', `<p>ejs ${v}</p>`], ['pug', `p pug ${v}`], ['hbs', `<p>hbs ${v}</p>`]]) {
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(views, `v.${ext}`), src);
  }
};

const cacheLocal = JSON.parse(process.argv[2]);     // true or false, passed per render
const ejsPkg = process.argv[3] || 'ejs';            // 'ejs' (7.0.1) or the alias 'ejs6' (6.0.1)
const app = express();
app.set('views', views);
app.engine('ejs', require(ejsPkg).__express);
app.engine('hbs', engine({ extname: '.hbs', defaultLayout: false }));
app.get('/:ext', (req, res) => {
  if (!['ejs', 'pug', 'hbs'].includes(req.params.ext)) return res.sendStatus(404);
  res.render('v.' + req.params.ext, { cache: cacheLocal });
});

(async () => {
  const server = app.listen(0);
  await once(server, 'listening');
  const base = `http://127.0.0.1:${server.address().port}`;
  const get = async () => (await Promise.all(['ejs', 'pug', 'hbs'].map(
    async (e) => (await fetch(`${base}/${e}`)).text()))).join(' ');
  write('v1'); await get();
  write('v2');
  console.log(`${ejsPkg} view cache=${app.get('view cache')} render({ cache: ${cacheLocal} }) after edit: ${await get()}`);
  server.close();
})();
```

bash

```
$ node override.cjs true; NODE_ENV=production node override.cjs false
ejs view cache=undefined render({ cache: true }) after edit: <p>ejs v2</p> <p>pug v1</p> <p>hbs v1</p>
ejs view cache=true render({ cache: false }) after edit: <p>ejs v1</p> <p>pug v2</p> <p>hbs v2</p>
$ node override.cjs true ejs6; NODE_ENV=production node override.cjs false ejs6
ejs6 view cache=undefined render({ cache: true }) after edit: <p>ejs v1</p> <p>pug v1</p> <p>hbs v1</p>
ejs6 view cache=true render({ cache: false }) after edit: <p>ejs v2</p> <p>pug v2</p> <p>hbs v2</p>
```

Pug and express-handlebars follow the `cache` local in both directions. EJS 7.0.1 ignores it: its `renderFile` only looks at `settings['view cache']`, so `cache: true` in development does not cache, and `cache: false` in production does **not** stop it serving the stale `v1`. EJS 6.0.1 copied `cache` from the data (its `_OPTS_PASSABLE_WITH_DATA_EXPRESS` list), so it behaved like the other two (changed in EJS 7.0.x). The reliable switch for all three is the app setting, `app.disable('view cache')`. The EJS 7.0.1 release on GitHub has no release notes, so this comes from reading both versions' source and from the runs above.

**Example 7 — `app.locals`, `res.locals` and render data: which one wins.**

javascript

```
// locals.cjs: where template variables come from, and which source wins.
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const express = require('express');
const request = require('supertest');

const views = path.join(__dirname, 'views');
fs.mkdirSync(views, { recursive: true });
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(views, 'who.ejs'),
  'site=<%= site %> user=<%= user %> theme=<%= theme %> ' +
  'year=<%= year() %> env=<%= settings.env %>');

const app = express();
app.set('views', views);
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.locals.site = 'Demo';                 // 1. app.locals: every render in this app
app.locals.theme = 'light';
app.locals.year = () => 2026;             //    functions work too (helpers)

app.use((req, res, next) => {             // 2. res.locals: this request only
  res.locals.user = req.get('x-user') ?? 'anonymous';
  res.locals.theme = 'dark';              //    overrides app.locals.theme
  next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.render('who'));
app.get('/override', (req, res) => res.render('who', { theme: 'contrast' })); // 3. render arg wins

(async () => {
  console.log((await request(app).get('/').set('x-user', 'ada')).text);
  console.log((await request(app).get('/')).text);
  console.log((await request(app).get('/override')).text);
})();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Express 5.3.0):
//   site=Demo user=ada theme=dark year=2026 env=development
//   site=Demo user=anonymous theme=dark year=2026 env=development
//   site=Demo user=anonymous theme=contrast year=2026 env=development
```

`res.locals.user` from the first request did not leak into the second, because `res.locals` is created per request. `settings.env` shows that every template can read the app settings.

**Example 8 — spreading `req.query` into the locals lets the client choose the layout file.**

javascript

```
// spread.cjs: never spread user input into render locals.
const path = require('node:path');
const express = require('express');
const { engine } = require('express-handlebars');
const request = require('supertest');

const app = express();
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views', 'hbs'));     // the Example 2 views
app.engine('hbs', engine({ extname: '.hbs' }));
app.set('view engine', 'hbs');
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.render('guestbook', { title: 'Guestbook', entries: [], ...req.query }));
app.use((err, req, res, next) => res.status(500).send(err.message.replace(__dirname, '<dir>')));

(async () => {
  for (const q of ['', '?layout=../guestbook', '?layout=nope']) {
    const r = await request(app).get('/' + q);
    console.log(q || '(none)', r.status, JSON.stringify(r.text.slice(0, 160)));
  }
})();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Express 5.3.0):
//   (none) 200 "<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head><title>Guestbook · </title></head>\n<body>\n<h1>Guestbook</h1>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<footer>Signed in as </footer>\n</body>\n</html>"
//   ?layout=../guestbook 200 "<h1>Guestbook</h1>\n<ul>\n</ul>"
//   ?layout=nope 500 "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '<dir>/views/hbs/layouts/nope.hbs'"
```

`layout` is an express-handlebars option, so `?layout=../guestbook` made it read a file outside `layouts/` as the layout, and `?layout=nope` produced an error that names a server path. The same applies to `cache` in Express and to `settings`. Pass the fields you mean: `{ q: String(req.query.q ?? '') }`.

**Example 9 — Express 4 vs 5: the render callback is always asynchronous in Express 5.**

javascript

```
// sync-engine.cjs: an engine that calls back synchronously, Express 4 vs Express 5 ordering.
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const request = require('supertest');

const views = path.join(__dirname, 'views');
fs.mkdirSync(views, { recursive: true });
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(views, 'x.sync'), 'hi');

async function run(pkg) {
  const express = require(pkg);
  const app = express();
  app.set('views', views);
  app.engine('sync', (file, opts, cb) => cb(null, fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8'))); // no I/O wait
  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    const order = [];
    res.render('x.sync', (err, html) => {
      order.push('render callback');
      res.send(order.join(' -> '));
    });
    order.push('line after res.render()');
  });
  console.log(pkg.padEnd(8), (await request(app).get('/')).text);
}
(async () => { await run('express4'); await run('express'); })();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Express 4.22.3 and 5.3.0):
//   express4 render callback
//   express  line after res.render() -> render callback
```

In Express 4.22.3 the callback ran *inside* `res.render()`, before the next line, and the response went out without it. Express 5 wraps a synchronous callback in `process.nextTick` (`View.prototype.render`), which the migration guide lists as an improvement: code after `res.render()` now always runs first, whatever the engine does.

**Example 10 — one route, HTML for browsers and JSON for API clients.**

javascript

```
// format.cjs: one route, two representations, chosen by the Accept header.
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const express = require('express');

const views = path.join(__dirname, 'views');
fs.mkdirSync(views, { recursive: true });
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(views, 'products.ejs'),
  '<ul><% for (const p of products) { %><li><%= p.name %>: $<%= p.price %></li><% } %></ul>\n');

const app = express();
app.set('views', views);
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
const products = [{ name: 'Mug', price: 8 }, { name: 'Tee', price: 20 }];

app.get('/products', (req, res) => {
  res.format({                                   // picks a branch from the Accept header
    html: () => res.render('products', { products }),
    json: () => res.json({ products }),
    default: () => res.status(406).send('Not Acceptable'),
  });
});

app.listen(5701, () => console.log('listening on 5701'));
```

bash

```

```

`res.format` added `Vary: Accept`, which tells caches that the same URL has different bodies for different `Accept` headers. Without it, a shared cache could hand the JSON to a browser.

## Common mistakes & gotchas

- **Relying on the default `views` path.** It is `process.cwd() + '/views'`, so it depends on where you start Node, not where your code lives. Set `app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'))`.
- **Raw output for user data.** `<%-`, `!{}` and `{{{ }}}` skip escaping (Example 3). Keep them for includes, the layout `body` and HTML you sanitised yourself.
- **Trusting escaping in every context.** A `javascript:` URL, an unquoted attribute and data inside `<script>` all get through an HTML escaper (Example 4).
- **Pug escapes fewer characters.** It leaves `'` alone, so `'#{x}'` inside a script or a single-quoted attribute is injectable.
- **Expecting template edits to show up in production.** `view cache` is on when `NODE_ENV=production` and engines keep compiled code (Example 5). Deploy templates with a restart.
- **Using `cache: false` per render to bypass the cache.** EJS 7.0.1 ignores it (Example 6). Use the app setting.
- **Thinking `NODE_ENV=Production` is production.** The check is a case-sensitive `=== 'production'`.
- **User input as the view name or spread into locals.** `res.render(req.params.page)` lets a client `require()` a module by extension (Example 1 rendered `page.path`), and a spread `req.query` can set `layout`, `cache` or `settings` (Example 8).
- **Putting secrets in `app.locals`.** Every template can read every key, and `settings` is already there.
- **Sending a response after `res.render` with a callback.** With a callback, `res.render` does not send anything. You must call `res.send(html)` yourself, and only once.

## Best practices

- **Set `views` with `__dirname`** and set `view engine`, so names like `res.render('orders/show')` stay short and don't depend on the working directory.
- **Keep escaping on by default.** Only use raw output for HTML your code produced, and grep for `<%-`, `!{` and `{{{` during review.
- **Handle each output context on purpose:** scheme allowlist for URLs, always-quoted attributes, `JSON.stringify` plus `<` → `<` for script data, and a CSP header as a backstop.
- **Fill `res.locals` in middleware** for per-request data that every page needs (user, CSRF token, flash), and use `app.locals` only for constants and helpers.
- **Pass explicit locals.** `{ q: req.query.q }`, not `...req.query`.
- **Leave `view cache` to `NODE_ENV`.** Run production with `NODE_ENV=production` and development without it. If you need the other behaviour, use `app.enable` or `app.disable`.
- **Use `app.render(name, data, cb)` for emails** and other HTML that is not an HTTP response. It takes the same views and locals, minus `res.locals`.
- **Pick one engine per app** and lock its version. EJS 6 → 7 changed caching behaviour with no release notes.

## ⭐ Interview lens

> **Q: “What happens, step by step, when a route calls `res.render('home')`?”**  
> A: `res.render` attaches `res.locals` and a default callback, then calls `app.render`. That merges `app.locals`, `res.locals` and the passed object (later wins), decides `cache` from `view cache`, and builds a `View`. The `View` takes the extension from the name or the `view engine` setting, gets the engine from `app.engine` or `require(ext).__express`, and looks for `<views>/home.<ext>` then `<views>/home/index.<ext>`. The engine is called as `(filePath, options, callback)`. Its HTML goes to `res.send`, and an error goes to `next(err)`. *Trap:* in Express 5 the callback is always asynchronous; in Express 4 a synchronous engine ran it inline.

> **Q: “Your template uses `<%= %>` everywhere. Is the page safe from XSS?”**  
> A: Only for values placed in element text or quoted attributes. HTML escaping does nothing for `href="javascript:…"`, for an unquoted attribute (a space starts a new attribute such as `onerror`), or inside `<script>`, where entities are not decoded. Use a scheme allowlist, quote attributes, serialise script data with `JSON.stringify` and escape `<`, and add a CSP. *Trap:* Pug's escaper leaves `'` alone.

> **Q: “You fixed a typo in a template and deployed by copying the file. Production still shows the typo. Why?”**  
> A: With `NODE_ENV=production`, Express enables `view cache`. It keeps the resolved `View` and passes `cache: true`, so the engine keeps the compiled template in memory and never reads the file again. Restart the process (the usual deploy does). Disabling it per render with `cache: false` does not work on every engine; EJS 7 ignores it.

> **Q: “`res.locals` vs `app.locals`?”**  
> A: `app.locals` lives as long as the app and is merged into every render, which suits the site name and helpers. `res.locals` is a new object per request, which suits the current user and the CSRF token, usually set by middleware. If both have a key, `res.locals` wins, and the object passed to `res.render` beats both.

> **Q: “When would you render HTML on the server instead of building a JSON API and a SPA?”**  
> A: When the pages are mostly content and forms, need to work with JavaScript off or for clients that don't run it (crawlers, link previews, email), and there is one front end owned by the same team. A JSON API fits several clients or a browser app with lots of client-side state. Both can come from one route with `res.format`. I would measure TTFB and LCP for the real pages rather than assume either is faster.

## Cheat-card

- **Contract:** engine = `(filePath, options, callback)`; register with `app.engine('ext', fn)` or export `__express` (EJS and Pug do; express-handlebars needs `app.engine`).
- **Settings:** `views` (default `process.cwd()/views`, can be an array), `view engine` (default extension), `view cache` (`true` only when `NODE_ENV === 'production'`, otherwise undefined).
- **Lookup:** `<dir>/<name><ext>`, then `<dir>/<name>/index<ext>`, for each dir in order; else `Failed to lookup view`.
- **Data merge:** `app.locals` < `res.locals` < `res.render(name, data)`. `settings` is always there; `cache` and engine options (`layout`) are read from it.
- **Escaped / raw:** EJS `<%= %>` / `<%- %>`; Pug `#{}` `=` / `!{}` `!=`; Handlebars `{{ }}` / `{{{ }}}`.
- **Escaped chars:** EJS `& < > " '`; Handlebars also `` ` `` and `=`; Pug only `& < > "`.
- **Not covered by escaping:** URL schemes, unquoted attributes, `<script>` contents. Use an allowlist, quotes, `JSON.stringify(v).replace(/</g,'\\u003c')`.
- **Layouts:** EJS include header/footer; Pug `extends` + `block`; express-handlebars `layouts/main` + `{{{body}}}`, `layout: false` to skip.
- **Partials:** EJS `include()` (runtime); Pug `include` (compile time) / `mixin`; Handlebars `{{> name}}` from `partials/`.
- **Caching:** cached = resolved View + compiled template; edits need a restart. EJS 7.0.1 ignores the per-render `cache` local.
- **Express 5:** render callback always async (changed in v5.0.0).
- **Both formats:** `res.format({ html, json })` adds `Vary: Accept`.
