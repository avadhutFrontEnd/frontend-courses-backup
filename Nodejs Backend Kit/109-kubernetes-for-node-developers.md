# Kubernetes for Node Developers

*30 min read · Updated 12 Oct 2026 · Topic 109 of 117 · added to this kit, not part of the original course*

**Source:** written for this kit — examples verified on Node v24.19.0 and Express 5.3.0, kubectl v1.37.1, kubeconform v0.8.0 (schemas for Kubernetes 1.37.1), systemd 259 (`systemd-run --user --scope` for cgroup memory limits). No cluster was available: the manifests were validated, not applied, and the app was run as a plain process.

## Why it matters

Kubernetes runs your Node process for you: it decides where it runs, restarts it when it hangs, sends it traffic only when it says it is ready, kills it when it uses too much memory, and replaces every copy of it on each deploy. Each of those decisions is driven by something you write: a probe endpoint, a memory limit, a signal handler, a number in a YAML file. If they do not match how Node behaves, the cluster does the wrong thing:

- **A liveness probe that checks the database** restarts every Pod at once when the database has a slow minute.
- **A memory limit of 512 MiB with the default V8 heap** gives Node a heap of 259 MiB inside that limit (measured in Example 7), so the app runs out of heap long before it uses the memory you paid for. Setting the heap too *large* is worse: the kernel kills the process with no JavaScript error at all.
- **A SIGTERM handler that closes the server at once** drops requests on every rolling update, because traffic keeps arriving for a few seconds after Kubernetes decides to stop the Pod.

This lesson covers the objects a Node developer writes (Pod, Deployment, Service, Ingress, ConfigMap, Secret, HorizontalPodAutoscaler), how probes and shutdown fit lesson [66](66-graceful-shutdown-monitoring.md), and how the memory limit interacts with `--max-old-space-size`. Everything Node-side was run. The manifests were validated with kubeconform and `kubectl --dry-run=client`. Cluster behaviour comes from the Kubernetes docs.

## The concept, simply

You describe the state you want in YAML objects and send them to the cluster's API server. Controllers keep comparing what you asked for with what is running and fix the difference. The objects a Node service needs:

- **Pod:** one or more containers that run together on one node, sharing an IP address. Your Node process runs in a container in a Pod. Pods are disposable; you rarely create them yourself.
- **Deployment:** "keep 3 Pods of this template running". It creates a ReplicaSet per version of the template, and on a change it rolls Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one.
- **Service:** a stable virtual IP and DNS name in front of every Pod whose labels match its `selector` *and* that is currently ready. Clients inside the cluster call `http://orders-api`, never a Pod IP.
- **Ingress:** HTTP routing from outside the cluster (host and path) to a Service, carried out by an Ingress controller you install. The Kubernetes docs now say the Ingress API "has been frozen" and recommend the newer Gateway API. Ingress remains generally available, with "no plans to remove" it.
- **ConfigMap and Secret:** key-value settings injected into the container as environment variables or files. The docs warn that Secrets are "by default, stored unencrypted in the API server's underlying data store (etcd)".
- **HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA):** changes the Deployment's replica count based on a metric such as CPU usage.

How they point at each other:

Three **probes** tell the kubelet (the agent on each node) how your process is doing:

- **Startup:** "has it finished starting?" Until it succeeds, the other two probes do not run.
- **Liveness:** "is it stuck?" Failing it restarts the container.
- **Readiness:** "should it get traffic right now?" Failing it removes the Pod from the Service's endpoints without restarting it.

## How it works

What happens from `kubectl apply` to a request reaching your Node process:

1. The API server stores the Deployment. The Deployment controller creates a ReplicaSet for this Pod template, and the ReplicaSet creates 3 Pod objects.
2. The scheduler picks a node for each Pod. It counts only **requests** (here 250m CPU and 512Mi memory), not actual usage, against each node's capacity.
3. The kubelet on that node pulls the image and starts the container. Your `CMD` becomes PID 1 in the container, which is the process that will receive SIGTERM later. So run `node server.mjs` directly, not through `npm start`. Node as PID 1 gets no default signal handling, so the app must install its own SIGTERM handler, as Example 1 does, or run under an init such as `tini` (lesson [65](65-pm2-docker.md) and the appendix of lesson [04](04-the-global-object-process-and-environment.md)).
4. The kubelet runs the **startup probe** (`GET /healthz` every 2 s, up to 30 failures, so 60 s to start). Liveness and readiness probes wait until it passes.
5. The **readiness probe** (`GET /readyz` every 5 s) starts returning 200 once the app has warmed up. Only then is the Pod listed as ready in the Service's EndpointSlices, and only then do kube-proxy and the Ingress controller send it traffic.
6. The **liveness probe** (`GET /healthz` every 10 s, 2 s timeout, 3 failures) runs for the life of the container. If the event loop is blocked for longer than about 30 s, three probes in a row time out and the kubelet restarts the container.

**Probe fields and defaults** (Kubernetes docs, "Liveness, Readiness, and Startup Probes"):

| Field | Default | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `initialDelaySeconds` | 0 | "If a startup probe is defined, liveness and readiness probe delays do not begin until the startup probe has succeeded." |
| `periodSeconds` | 10 | Minimum 1 |
| `timeoutSeconds` | 1 | A Node process with a busy event loop can miss 1 s; this lesson uses 2 for liveness |
| `successThreshold` | 1 | "Must be 1 for liveness and startup Probes." |
| `failureThreshold` | 3 | Startup budget = `failureThreshold × periodSeconds` |

Readiness probes "run on the container during its whole lifecycle", so a Pod can drop out of the Service and come back without a restart. That is what the 503 from `/readyz` is for. What each probe should check follows from what failing it does. Liveness restarts the process, so it must check only the process itself: never the database, or one database blip restarts every Pod. Readiness only stops traffic, so it may check critical dependencies, and it must report not-ready once shutdown begins (lesson 66).

**How readiness and SIGTERM work together during a rolling update.** When a Pod is deleted (by a rolling update, a scale-down or a node drain), the Kubernetes "Pod termination flow" runs two things at the same time:

- **On the node:** the kubelet runs the container's `preStop` hook if there is one, then sends SIGTERM to PID 1. If the container is still running when `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (default 30) runs out, the runtime sends SIGKILL. The grace period "applies to the total time it takes for both the PreStop hook to execute and for the Container to stop normally".
- **In the control plane:** the Pod's endpoint is marked terminating, and "Terminating endpoints always have their ready status as false … so load balancers will not use it for regular traffic".

The endpoint change is not instant everywhere. kube-proxy on every node and the Ingress controller each have to notice it and update their routing. Until they do, new connections still arrive at the Pod. So the Pod must keep serving for a few seconds after it learns it is being stopped, and only then stop accepting connections. In this lesson's Deployment, that wait is a `preStop` `sleep` of 5 s, which runs before SIGTERM. The app's own `DRAIN_DELAY_MS` is therefore set to 0 in the ConfigMap, so the two waits do not add up. When SIGTERM arrives, the app flips `/readyz` to 503. That matters for anything that still probes the Pod directly, and it is the only signal on platforms without endpoint tracking. Then the app calls `server.close()`, lets in-flight requests finish, closes its pools and exits 0. A forced-exit timer (20 s) fires first if a request hangs, so 5 s + 20 s stays inside the 30 s grace period and the kubelet never needs SIGKILL.

![Graceful Shutdown on SIGTERM: the orchestrator sends SIGTERM, the app flips its readiness probe to not ready, server.close() stops new connections, in-flight requests drain, resources close, and the process exits, with a forced-exit timer as a safety net](assets/i63_01_85ccfa6f.svg)
*Figure: the shutdown sequence lesson 66's handler runs on SIGTERM, which is what the kubelet sends after `preStop`. Look at: step 2, readiness flips to not ready before `server.close()`, so the Pod keeps serving while traffic moves away.*

The timeline for this lesson's manifests:

text

```
t=0s   Pod marked Terminating (e.g. rolling update)
       ├─ control plane: endpoint ready=false → kube-proxy / Ingress controller start removing it
       └─ kubelet: runs preStop sleep 5s — the app is still serving normally
t=5s   kubelet sends SIGTERM to PID 1 (node server.mjs)
       app: /readyz → 503, server.close(), in-flight requests finish, pools close, exit(0)
t≤25s  app's forced-exit timer (FORCE_EXIT_MS=20000) fires if something hangs → exit(1)
t=30s  terminationGracePeriodSeconds ends → SIGKILL to anything still running
```

> ⚠️ Unverified: how long endpoint removal takes to reach kube-proxy and Ingress controllers in a real cluster, and therefore whether 5 s of `preStop` is enough. No cluster was available. The local run in Example 2 shows only the Node side.

**The `preStop` `sleep` action** (stable in Kubernetes 1.34, beta and on by default from 1.30) is run by the kubelet, so the image needs no `sleep` binary. That matters for distroless images. On older clusters the usual form is `exec: { command: ["sleep", "5"] }`, which does need the binary in the image.

**Resources: requests and limits.** A **request** is what the scheduler reserves for the container. HPA's CPU utilisation is also measured against it. A **limit** is enforced by the kernel through cgroups, and the Kubernetes docs describe the two resources differently:

- **CPU limit:** "enforced by CPU throttling". A Node process over its CPU limit is slowed down, which shows up as event-loop lag and slow probes.
- **Memory limit:** "enforced by the kernel with out of memory (OOM) kills". The process gets SIGKILL with no chance to log or drain. It "may not be immediately killed", because the kill happens when the kernel detects memory pressure.

This lesson's Deployment sets a CPU request, no CPU limit, and a memory request equal to the memory limit (512Mi). The memory is then reserved on the node, and the limit sits at a known point.

**The memory limit and the V8 heap.** Node's memory is the V8 heap (your objects) plus memory outside it: Buffers, compiled code, thread stacks, native libraries. The memory limit applies to all of it. V8 has its own ceiling for the heap, `heap_size_limit`. When the heap reaches it, Node aborts with `FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory` (exit code 134). In one re-run the same script printed `FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit …` instead, so match on `JavaScript heap out of memory`. Measured on Node v24.19.0 with the same script under different cgroup memory limits (Example 7):

| Memory limit (cgroup `MemoryMax`) | Node flags | `process.constrainedMemory()` | `heap_size_limit` |
|---|---|---|---|
| none (15 GiB machine) | — | 18446744073709552000 | 2240 MiB |
| 512 MiB | — | 536870912 | 259 MiB |
| 1 GiB | — | 1073741824 | 560 MiB |
| 2 GiB | — | 2147483648 | 1120 MiB |
| 512 MiB | `--max-old-space-size=384` | 536870912 | 387 MiB |
| 512 MiB | `--max-old-space-size-percentage=75` | 536870912 | 387 MiB |
| 512 MiB | `--max-old-space-size=4096` | 536870912 | 4099 MiB |

What this shows for Node 24:

- **Node reads the cgroup limit.** `process.constrainedMemory()` returned the cgroup value, and the default heap followed it: about half of the limit at each size tested. With a 512Mi limit and no flag, the heap stops at 259 MiB even though another ~250 MiB is free.
- **`--max-old-space-size=<MiB>` overrides the default** with a fixed number. 384 MiB of a 512 MiB limit leaves 128 MiB for everything outside the heap.
- **`--max-old-space-size-percentage=<n>`** (added in v24.6.0) sets the old space as a percentage of "available system memory". Here that was the cgroup limit, not the host's 15 GiB: 75% gave the same 387 MiB as the fixed 384. The docs say it "takes precedence over `--max-old-space-size` when both are specified". It works in `NODE_OPTIONS` too. Because it follows the limit, one image works at any memory size.
- **A heap larger than the limit is the dangerous case.** With `--max-old-space-size=4096` under 512 MiB, V8 never runs out of heap. The kernel kills the process first, with exit code 137 (128 + SIGKILL 9), no error and no stack (Example 7). In Kubernetes that is the container status `OOMKilled`.

> ⚠️ Unverified: the `OOMKilled` status and restart count as shown by `kubectl describe pod`. The kill itself (exit 137 under a 512 MiB cgroup limit) was reproduced with `systemd-run`, not with a kubelet.

**HPA (autoscaling/v2).** The HPA controller runs every 15 seconds by default (`--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-sync-period`). It reads CPU usage from the `metrics.k8s.io` API, "usually provided by an add-on named Metrics Server, which needs to be launched separately". It computes utilisation "as a percentage of the equivalent resource request", so a Deployment with no CPU request cannot be scaled on CPU utilisation. The formula from the docs:

text

```
desiredReplicas = ceil( currentReplicas × currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue )

3 Pods averaging 140% of their 250m request, target 70%:  ceil(3 × 140 / 70) = 6
6 Pods averaging  35%,                     target 70%:  ceil(6 ×  35 / 70) = 3  (after the 300 s window)
```

The default behaviour has no stabilisation window for scale-up: it may add "4 pods or a 100% of the currently running replicas" every 15 s, whichever is more. Scale-down uses a 300 s window and takes "the highest value from the specified interval", so a short dip does not remove Pods. `minReplicas: 3` keeps capacity for a rolling update and for a node failure.

> ⚠️ Unverified: actual scaling events and timing. No cluster and no Metrics Server were available. The arithmetic above is the docs' formula, worked by hand.

**Rolling updates: `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable`.** On a template change (for example a new image tag), the Deployment creates a new ReplicaSet and moves Pods to it within two limits:

- **`maxSurge`:** how many Pods may exist *above* `replicas`.
- **`maxUnavailable`:** how many may be *missing* from `replicas`.

Both accept a number or a percentage, and both default to 25%. The docs' example: with 3 replicas and the defaults, the rollout "makes sure that at least 3 Pods are available and that at max 4 Pods in total are available". This lesson sets them explicitly to `maxSurge: 1, maxUnavailable: 0`: start one new Pod, wait until it is ready, then terminate one old Pod (which runs the shutdown sequence above), and repeat:

text

```
3 replicas (HPA minimum), maxSurge: 1, maxUnavailable: 0  ready old  ready new  total
start                                                        3          0      3
create new-1 (surge)                                         3          0      4
new-1 passes startup + readiness → terminate old-1           2          1      4 → 3
create new-2 …                                               2          1      4
… until                                                      0          3      3
```

A new Pod counts as available only after its readiness probe passes (plus `minReadySeconds`, default 0). That is why a readiness endpoint that returns 200 before the app has connected to its database lets a rollout replace working Pods with broken ones.

> ⚠️ Unverified: the rollout sequence above was not observed with `kubectl rollout status` on a cluster. It follows the Deployment docs.

**ConfigMap changes need a restart for environment variables.** The docs: "ConfigMaps consumed as environment variables are not updated automatically and require a pod restart." `kubectl rollout restart deployment/orders-api` replaces the Pods using the same rolling-update rules.

## Code examples

**Example 1 — an Express 5 app with startup, liveness and readiness endpoints and a SIGTERM drain.**

This is lesson 66's shutdown sequence with two settings read from the environment: the drain delay (0 in the cluster, where `preStop` does the waiting) and the forced-exit timer.

javascript

```
// server.mjs — an Express 5 app shaped for Kubernetes: probes, readiness flip, drain, exit
import express from 'express';
import { setTimeout as sleep } from 'node:timers/promises';

const PORT = Number(process.env.PORT ?? 3000);
const DRAIN_DELAY_MS = Number(process.env.DRAIN_DELAY_MS ?? 5000);    // 0 when a preStop sleep does the wait
const FORCE_EXIT_MS = Number(process.env.FORCE_EXIT_MS ?? 20000);     // keep below terminationGracePeriodSeconds
const t0 = Number(process.env.T0 ?? Date.now());                      // shared clock with the demo client
const log = (msg) => console.log(`[server +${String(Date.now() - t0).padStart(5)}ms] ${msg}`);

let ready = false;          // false until warm-up is done, false again once SIGTERM arrives
let shuttingDown = false;

const app = express();
app.use((req, res, next) => {                                          // once draining, close each keep-alive
  res.on('finish', () => {                                             // socket as soon as its response ends
    if (shuttingDown) setImmediate(() => server.closeIdleConnections());
  });
  next();
});
app.get('/healthz', (req, res) => res.send('ok'));                     // liveness: no dependency checks
app.get('/readyz', (req, res) => {                                     // readiness: may this pod get traffic?
  if (!ready || shuttingDown) return res.status(503).send('not ready');
  res.send('ready');
});
app.get('/work', async (req, res) => {                                  // a request that takes a while
  await sleep(Number(req.query.ms ?? 1000));
  res.json({ done: true, ms: Number(req.query.ms ?? 1000) });
});

const server = app.listen(PORT, async () => {
  log(`listening on ${PORT}, not ready yet`);
  await sleep(1000);                                                    // stands in for warm-up: DB pool, caches
  ready = true;
  log('warm-up done, /readyz -> 200');
});
server.keepAliveTimeout = 5000;

async function shutdown(signal) {
  if (shuttingDown) return;                                             // signals can repeat
  shuttingDown = true;
  log(`${signal} received, /readyz -> 503, still serving for ${DRAIN_DELAY_MS} ms`);
  setTimeout(() => { log('drain timed out, forcing exit'); process.exit(1); }, FORCE_EXIT_MS).unref();

  await sleep(DRAIN_DELAY_MS);                                          // keep serving while routing catches up
  log('server.close(): no new connections, waiting for in-flight requests');
  server.close(async () => {
    // close DB pools, Redis, queue consumers here (lesson 66)
    log('all connections closed, exit 0');
    process.exit(0);
  });
  server.closeIdleConnections();                                        // idle keep-alive sockets
}
process.on('SIGTERM', () => shutdown('SIGTERM'));
process.on('SIGINT', () => shutdown('SIGINT'));
```

**Example 2 — a real SIGTERM: readiness flips, requests drain, the process exits 0.**

The driver starts the server, waits for it to become ready, starts a 3-second request, sends a real `SIGTERM` with `child.kill('SIGTERM')`, and keeps probing. Locally there is no `preStop`, so the app's own `DRAIN_DELAY_MS=2000` plays that part. Both processes print milliseconds since the same start time.

javascript

```
// sigterm-demo.mjs — start server.mjs, send it a real SIGTERM mid-request, watch the probes
import { spawn } from 'node:child_process';
import { setTimeout as sleep } from 'node:timers/promises';

const PORT = 7101;
const base = `http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}`;
const t0 = Date.now();
const log = (msg) => console.log(`[client +${String(Date.now() - t0).padStart(5)}ms] ${msg}`);
const get = async (path) => {
  try { const r = await fetch(base + path); return `${r.status} ${await r.text()}`; }
  catch (err) { return `failed: ${err.cause?.code ?? err.message}`; }
};

const child = spawn(process.execPath, [process.argv[2] ?? 'server.mjs'], {
  env: { ...process.env, T0: String(t0), PORT: String(PORT), DRAIN_DELAY_MS: '2000', FORCE_EXIT_MS: '10000' },
  stdio: ['ignore', 'inherit', 'inherit'],
});
const exited = new Promise((resolve) => child.on('exit', (code, sig) => resolve({ code, sig })));

await sleep(300);
log(`GET /healthz -> ${await get('/healthz')}`);
log(`GET /readyz  -> ${await get('/readyz')}`);
await sleep(1000);
log(`GET /readyz  -> ${await get('/readyz')}`);

const slow = get('/work?ms=3000').then((r) => log(`in-flight GET /work?ms=3000 -> ${r}`));
await sleep(200);
log('sending SIGTERM');
child.kill('SIGTERM');
await sleep(100);
log(`GET /readyz  -> ${await get('/readyz')}`);
log(`GET /healthz -> ${await get('/healthz')}`);
log(`GET /work?ms=50 (arrives during the drain delay) -> ${await get('/work?ms=50')}`);
await sleep(2200);
log(`GET /healthz (after server.close) -> ${await get('/healthz')}`);
await slow;
const { code, sig } = await exited;
log(`server exited: code=${code} signal=${sig}`);
```

bash

```
$ node sigterm-demo.mjs
[server +  151ms] listening on 7101, not ready yet
[client +  351ms] GET /healthz -> 200 ok
[client +  355ms] GET /readyz  -> 503 not ready
[server + 1152ms] warm-up done, /readyz -> 200
[client + 1359ms] GET /readyz  -> 200 ready
[client + 1559ms] sending SIGTERM
[server + 1560ms] SIGTERM received, /readyz -> 503, still serving for 2000 ms
[client + 1663ms] GET /readyz  -> 503 not ready
[client + 1667ms] GET /healthz -> 200 ok
[client + 1720ms] GET /work?ms=50 (arrives during the drain delay) -> 200 {"done":true,"ms":50}
[server + 3561ms] server.close(): no new connections, waiting for in-flight requests
[client + 3922ms] GET /healthz (after server.close) -> failed: ECONNREFUSED
[server + 4361ms] all connections closed, exit 0
[client + 4362ms] in-flight GET /work?ms=3000 -> 200 {"done":true,"ms":3000}
[client + 4366ms] server exited: code=0 signal=null
```

Reading it against the timeline in How it works:

- **Before warm-up** (+351 ms), liveness was already 200 but readiness was 503. The startup and liveness probes pass, but the Pod is not yet in the Service.
- **On SIGTERM** (+1559 ms), `/readyz` turned 503 within the next request. `/healthz` stayed 200, so a liveness probe would not restart the Pod while it drains.
- **During the 2 s drain delay,** a new request (`/work?ms=50`) was still served, as it would be while kube-proxy catches up.
- **After `server.close()`** (+3561 ms), new connections were refused (`ECONNREFUSED`). The request that was in flight when SIGTERM arrived still completed with 200.
- **The exit:** the process exited 0 at +4361 ms, right after the last response and long before the 10 s forced-exit timer.

**Example 3 — edge case: an idle keep-alive socket delays the exit by 3 seconds.**

`server-v1.mjs` is Example 1 without the `res.on('finish', …)` middleware. Lesson 66 calls `server.closeIdleConnections()` once, right after `server.close()`. Here the 3-second request was still active at that moment, so its socket was not idle and stayed open. When the response finished, the socket became an idle keep-alive connection, and nothing closed it:

bash

```
$ node sigterm-demo.mjs server-v1.mjs
[server +  101ms] listening on 7101, not ready yet
[client +  349ms] GET /healthz -> 200 ok
[client +  353ms] GET /readyz  -> 503 not ready
[server + 1102ms] warm-up done, /readyz -> 200
[client + 1357ms] GET /readyz  -> 200 ready
[client + 1557ms] sending SIGTERM
[server + 1557ms] SIGTERM received, /readyz -> 503, still serving for 2000 ms
[client + 1660ms] GET /readyz  -> 503 not ready
[client + 1663ms] GET /healthz -> 200 ok
[client + 1717ms] GET /work?ms=50 (arrives during the drain delay) -> 200 {"done":true,"ms":50}
[server + 3559ms] server.close(): no new connections, waiting for in-flight requests
[client + 3919ms] GET /healthz (after server.close) -> failed: ECONNREFUSED
[client + 4360ms] in-flight GET /work?ms=3000 -> 200 {"done":true,"ms":3000}
[server + 7363ms] all connections closed, exit 0
[client + 7368ms] server exited: code=0 signal=null
```

The response arrived at +4360 ms, but the exit came 3 s later (+7363 ms). The 3 s is the client's doing. Node's `fetch` (undici 7.29.0, bundled with v24.19.0) keeps an idle socket for the server's `Keep-Alive: timeout=5` hint minus its `keepAliveTimeoutThreshold` (default 2 s), then closes it. A load balancer or another Node service holding a pool of keep-alive connections may hold them longer, up to the server's own `keepAliveTimeout` or until the forced-exit timer fires. The fix in Example 1 is to call `closeIdleConnections()` again whenever a response finishes during shutdown. With it, the exit followed the last response at once (+4361 ms in Example 2).

**Example 4 — the manifests.**

None of these was applied to a cluster. Example 5 validates them.

Notes on the choices:

- **Image tag:** `image` uses a fixed tag, never `latest`, so a rollout is triggered by changing the tag and can be rolled back.
- **Ingress class:** `ingressClassName: example` stands for whatever IngressClass your cluster's controller registers.
- **Ports by name:** `targetPort: http` and the probes' `port: http` refer to the container port by name, so the number lives in one place.

**Example 5 — validating without a cluster: kubeconform and `kubectl apply --dry-run=client`.**

Both binaries were downloaded from their official release locations and checked against the published SHA-256 sums. They were run from a directory under `~/.cache`, not installed system-wide. The kubectl download stalled once and was resumed with `curl -C -` before the check.

bash

```
$ curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.37.1/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
$ curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.37.1/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"
$ echo "$(cat kubectl.sha256)  kubectl" | sha256sum --check
kubectl: OK
$ chmod +x kubectl && ./kubectl version --client
Client Version: v1.37.1
Kustomize Version: v5.8.1
$ curl -LO https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform/releases/download/v0.8.0/kubeconform-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ curl -LO https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform/releases/download/v0.8.0/CHECKSUMS
$ grep linux-amd64.tar.gz CHECKSUMS | sha256sum --check
kubeconform-linux-amd64.tar.gz: OK
$ tar xzf kubeconform-linux-amd64.tar.gz kubeconform && ./kubeconform -v
v0.8.0
```

kubeconform validates each object against the JSON schema generated from the Kubernetes OpenAPI spec for a given version. `-strict` rejects fields that the schema does not define, and `-summary` prints the totals. The schemas are downloaded from GitHub on first use, so `-cache` keeps them for the next run:

bash

```
$ kubeconform -strict -summary -kubernetes-version 1.37.1 -cache …/kcache k8s/; echo "exit=$?"
Summary: 6 resources found in 6 files - Valid: 6, Invalid: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
exit=0
```

Then `kubectl apply --dry-run=client`, with no cluster and no kubeconfig (`$HOME` pointed at an empty directory, so kubectl fell back to `localhost:8080`):

bash

```
$ kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f k8s/; echo "exit=$?"
error validating "k8s/configmap.yaml": error validating data: failed to download openapi: Get "http://localhost:8080/openapi/v2?timeout=32s": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused; if you choose to ignore these errors, turn validation off with --validate=false
…
exit=1
```

The first failure is validation. kubectl validates against the OpenAPI schema it downloads *from the API server*, and the error message itself suggests `--validate=false`. That gets one step further, and fails again:

bash

```
$ kubectl apply --dry-run=client --validate=false -f k8s/; echo "exit=$?"
E1012 23:39:45.874865 2289348 memcache.go:381] "Couldn't get current server API group list" err="Get \"http://localhost:8080/api?timeout=32s\": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused"
…
unable to recognize "k8s/configmap.yaml": Get "http://localhost:8080/api?timeout=32s": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused
…
exit=1
```

`apply` needs the server's discovery API (`/api`) to map each `kind` to a REST resource, even in client dry-run mode, and fails with "unable to recognize" when it cannot reach it. So `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` cannot be used without a reachable API server, with or without `--validate=false`. The kubectl command that does run offline is a `--local` one, which only parses the files and recognises the kinds:

bash

```
$ kubectl label --local -f k8s/ team=orders -o name; echo "exit=$?"
configmap/orders-api-config
deployment.apps/orders-api
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/orders-api
ingress.networking.k8s.io/orders-api
secret/orders-api-secrets
service/orders-api
exit=0
```

That proves the YAML parses and every `kind`/`apiVersion` pair is one kubectl knows. Example 6 shows it does not check field types or names. Against a real cluster, `kubectl apply --dry-run=server -f k8s/` adds the server's own validation and admission checks.

> ⚠️ Unverified: `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` and `--dry-run=server` against a live API server. No cluster was available.

**Example 6 — edge case: a broken manifest, and what each validator catches.**

What each check caught:

| Mistake | `kubeconform -strict` | `kubeconform` (no `-strict`) | `kubectl label --local` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `replicas: "3"` (string) | caught | caught | not caught |
| `containerport` (wrong case) | caught twice: unknown field and missing `containerPort` | caught only as missing `containerPort` | not caught |
| `readinessprobe` (wrong case) | caught: "additional properties 'readinessprobe' not allowed" | **not caught** | not caught |

The third row is the dangerous one. Without `-strict`, the validator accepts the misspelled probe. If the cluster's field validation also lets the unknown field through (ignore or warn), it is dropped, and the Pod runs with no readiness probe, receiving traffic before it is ready.

> ⚠️ Unverified: what a live API server does with the unknown `readinessprobe` field (warn, or reject under strict field validation). No cluster was available.

**Example 7 — the V8 heap under a cgroup memory limit.**

`systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=…` runs a command in a new cgroup with a memory limit. This is the same kernel mechanism the kubelet uses for a container's memory limit, and it needs no root. The script prints what Node sees:

javascript

```

import v8 from 'node:v8';
import os from 'node:os';

const mib = (n) => `${Math.round(n / 1024 / 1024)} MiB`;
console.log('flags              :', process.execArgv.join(' ') || process.env.NODE_OPTIONS || '(none)');
console.log('os.totalmem()      :', mib(os.totalmem()));
console.log('constrainedMemory():', process.constrainedMemory(), 'bytes');
console.log('heap_size_limit    :', mib(v8.getHeapStatistics().heap_size_limit));
```

```

The first run shows a value that differs from the docs. With no cgroup memory limit (a scope without `MemoryMax` reads `memory.max` as `max`, as the last command shows), `process.constrainedMemory()` returned 18446744073709552000, which is 2^64 as a JavaScript number, not the `0` that the v24 docs describe for "no such constraint". Treat any value above `os.totalmem()` as "no limit".

Now fill the heap until something stops the process. `MemorySwapMax=0` keeps the kernel from swapping instead of killing, which matches a typical Kubernetes node.

javascript

```
// fill.mjs — keep allocating until something stops the process
import v8 from 'node:v8';

const mib = (n) => Math.round(n / 1024 / 1024);
console.log('heap_size_limit', mib(v8.getHeapStatistics().heap_size_limit), 'MiB');
const keep = [];
for (let i = 1; ; i++) {
  keep.push(new Array(1024 * 1024).fill(i));     // about 8 MiB of heap per step
  if (i % 16 === 0) {
    const { heapUsed, rss } = process.memoryUsage();
    console.log('heapUsed', mib(heapUsed), 'MiB, rss', mib(rss), 'MiB');
  }
}
```

bash

```

The three runs end in three different ways:

- **Default heap:** V8 stopped at 259 MiB with a heap OOM (exit 134) while the cgroup still had about 200 MiB free.
- **`--max-old-space-size=384`:** the heap reached 388 MiB before the same heap OOM (exit 134). RSS was 431 MiB, still under the limit, and the logs get V8's `FATAL ERROR` line, its last GC lines and a native stack trace.
- **`--max-old-space-size=4096`:** V8 kept growing until the kernel killed the process at the limit, with exit code 137 and no message from Node at all.

## Common mistakes & gotchas

- **Dependencies in the liveness probe.** A database outage then restarts every Pod at once, and the restarts make it worse. Liveness checks the process. Readiness checks dependencies.
- **No startup probe for a slow start.** Without it, the liveness probe starts at once and can kill a Pod that is still loading. Use `failureThreshold × periodSeconds` as the startup budget.
- **`timeoutSeconds: 1` on a busy Node process.** A garbage-collection pause or a burst of synchronous work can miss a 1 s probe. Three misses restart a healthy Pod. Use 2–5 s for liveness, and fix event-loop blocking (lesson [10](10-blocking-the-event-loop.md)).
- **Closing the server the moment SIGTERM arrives.** Endpoint removal takes time to reach every node. Keep serving for a few seconds (`preStop` sleep) before `server.close()`.
- **Adding the waits up past the grace period.** `preStop` + drain delay + forced-exit timer must be less than `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, which includes the `preStop` time. Otherwise SIGKILL cuts the drain short.
- **`npm start` as PID 1.** SIGTERM goes to PID 1. Run `node` directly, or use an init such as `tini`, as lesson 65 does.
- **A heap bigger than the memory limit.** `--max-old-space-size` above the limit turns a debuggable heap OOM into a silent SIGKILL (exit 137). Without any flag, the default heap is only about half the limit.
- **CPU utilisation HPA with no CPU request.** Utilisation is a percentage of the request, so with no request the HPA cannot compute it.
- **`replicas` in the Deployment fighting the HPA.** Every `kubectl apply` resets the count to the file's value, and the HPA then scales it back. The HPA docs recommend removing `spec.replicas` once an HPA is enabled, as Example 4 does. On an existing Deployment, the first apply without it falls back to the default of 1 Pod once, so do that step with care.
- **kubeconform without `-strict`.** A misspelled field such as `readinessprobe` passes validation and can end up dropped, leaving the Pod with no readiness probe (Example 6).
- **Expecting ConfigMap edits to reach environment variables.** They do not until the Pods restart.
- **Secrets in git.** The manifest in Example 4 is a placeholder. Base64 in a Secret is encoding, not encryption.

## Best practices

- **Three endpoints, three jobs:** startup and liveness on a cheap `/healthz`; readiness on `/readyz`, which checks critical dependencies and returns 503 from the first moment of shutdown.
- **Shutdown budget written down:** `preStop` sleep (5 s) + forced-exit timer (20 s) < `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (30 s); log each step of the drain.
- **Set the heap from the limit:** `--max-old-space-size` at about 75% of the memory limit, or `--max-old-space-size-percentage=75` on Node ≥ 24.6.0; check the result with `v8.getHeapStatistics().heap_size_limit` at startup.
- **Memory request = memory limit;** set a CPU request, and add a CPU limit only if you have measured the throttling it causes.
- **`maxSurge: 1, maxUnavailable: 0`** (or percentages) for services that must not lose capacity during a rollout, plus `minReplicas` ≥ 2 on the HPA.
- **Validate in CI** with `kubeconform -strict -summary -kubernetes-version <your cluster version>`, plus a server-side dry run against a real cluster before production.
- **Fixed image tags and named ports;** keep config in ConfigMaps and real secrets in a secret manager.
- **Let the HPA own the replica count:** no `spec.replicas` in a Deployment that an HPA scales.

## ⭐ Interview lens

> **Q: “Liveness, readiness and startup probes: what does each do, and what should each check in a Node app?”**  
> A: Startup gates the other two until the app has started. Its budget is `failureThreshold × periodSeconds`. Liveness restarts the container when it fails, so it should check only that the process and event loop respond: a cheap `/healthz` with no dependency calls. Readiness removes the Pod from the Service without restarting it, so it can check critical dependencies, and it must return 503 once shutdown starts. *Trap:* a database check in liveness restarts every Pod during a database blip.

> **Q: “Walk me through what happens to a Pod during a rolling update, and how the Node app should behave.”**  
> A: The Pod is marked terminating. At the same time, the control plane marks its endpoint not ready, and the kubelet runs `preStop`, then sends SIGTERM to PID 1. The endpoint change takes a moment to reach kube-proxy and the Ingress controller, so the app keeps serving during a short `preStop` sleep. On SIGTERM it flips readiness to 503, calls `server.close()`, closes idle keep-alive sockets, waits for in-flight requests, closes pools and exits 0. A forced-exit timer shorter than `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, which includes `preStop`, guards against a hung request. With `maxSurge: 1, maxUnavailable: 0`, the old Pod is only stopped after a new one is ready.

> **Q: “A container has a 512Mi memory limit. How does that interact with the Node heap?”**  
> A: The limit covers the whole process: heap, Buffers, code and stacks. On Node 24, V8 sizes its default heap from the cgroup limit: 259 MiB under 512 MiB in my test, about half. Set `--max-old-space-size` to about 75% of the limit (384), or `--max-old-space-size-percentage=75` on 24.6+, so the heap uses the memory but leaves room for off-heap use. If the heap setting is above the limit, the kernel OOM-kills the process with SIGKILL (exit 137) before V8 reports anything.

> **Q: “How does the HPA decide how many Pods to run?”**  
> A: Every 15 s it reads the metric (CPU from Metrics Server, as a percentage of the request) and computes `ceil(current × actual / target)`. Scale-up is immediate by default, up to 100% or 4 Pods per 15 s, whichever is more. Scale-down waits for a 300 s stabilisation window and uses the highest recommendation in it. It needs CPU requests on the Pods and Metrics Server in the cluster.

## Cheat-card

- **Objects:** Pod (containers + IP) ← ReplicaSet ← Deployment ← HPA; Service selects *ready* Pods; Ingress (frozen API; Gateway API recommended) routes to a Service; ConfigMap/Secret feed env vars (restart to pick up changes).
- **Probe defaults:** period 10 s, timeout 1 s, failureThreshold 3, successThreshold 1; startup gates the others; readiness runs all the time.
- **Shutdown:** terminating → endpoint ready=false ∥ `preStop` → SIGTERM to PID 1 → app 503 + `server.close()` + drain → exit 0; SIGKILL at `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (30 s default, includes `preStop`).
- **`preStop: sleep: { seconds: 5 }`:** stable in 1.34 (beta from 1.30); run by the kubelet, so no binary is needed.
- **Limits:** CPU over the limit → throttled; memory over the limit → SIGKILL (exit 137, `OOMKilled`).
- **Heap under a cgroup limit (Node 24.19.0):** default ≈ ½ the limit (259 MiB of 512); `--max-old-space-size=384` → 387 MiB; `--max-old-space-size-percentage=75` (v24.6.0+) → 387 MiB; too large → kernel kill.
- **HPA v2:** `ceil(current × actual/target)`; 15 s loop; scale-down window 300 s; needs Metrics Server + CPU requests.
- **Rollout:** `maxSurge`/`maxUnavailable` default 25%; `1/0` = never below `replicas`; new Pods count once ready.
- **Validate offline:** `kubeconform -strict -summary -kubernetes-version 1.37.1 dir/`; `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` needs a reachable API server even with `--validate=false`; `kubectl label --local -f dir/ k=v -o name` only parses.
- **Versions used:** Node v24.19.0, Express 5.3.0, kubectl v1.37.1, kubeconform v0.8.0, undici 7.29.0 (bundled), systemd 259.
