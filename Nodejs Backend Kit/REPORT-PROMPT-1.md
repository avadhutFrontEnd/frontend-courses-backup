# REPORT — Prompt 1 (repair pass, 2026-10-07)

Scope: repair the 15 audited errors (lessons 08, 14, 26, 28, 35, 37, 38, 41, 42, 45, 62, 64, 65, 68, 70), then sweep the kit for the same bug classes. No new topics were added. Only the incorrect passages were edited; every lesson keeps its 9 standard `##` sections, its CRLF line endings and balanced code fences.

Environment: Node **v24.19.0**, npm 11.17.0 (full list of library and tool versions in CORRECTIONS.md). All code ran in a scratch directory outside the kit. Postgres, Redis and hadolint were placed in `~/.cache/nodekit-repair-tools`, because `/tmp` is mounted `noexec`. No Docker daemon was available.

| File | Repair | Verification run | SVGs embedded | Unverified items |

| 37-error-handling-the-4-arg-handler-and-async-errors.md | Unhandled async error crashes the process by default (Node 15+); hangs only when swallowed; Example 2b demonstrates crash / hang / Express 5 500 | spawned servers + fetch / curl; Node CLI docs | none (i34_01 already here and still accurate; i51_01 is only loosely related, so not embedded) | none |
| 38-the-req-and-res-objects-reading-and-responding.md | `req.body` is `undefined` in Express 5 with no body / no matching parser; `/login` destructure guarded | 4 configs × 5 requests; lesson block as saved | none (i35_01 already here) | none |

| 27, 34, 48, 51, 52, 53 (**sweep**) | 16 KB claim (27); Express 5 request changes listed (34); `req.body ?? {}` (48, 51 ×2); `max` → `limit` (52 ×2); Express 5 dependency stated for "just throw" (53) | same runs as above; `node l52.cjs` → `200 200 200 200 200 429` | none | none |

**Unverified items:** none were left in the lessons, and no `> ⚠️ Unverified` marker was needed. The only verification gap is lesson 65, which was linted rather than built.

**Final link check** (step 6, over all 24 changed or new Markdown files): 35 image links, **0 failures**. Every link resolves, every referenced SVG is well-formed XML, no SVG has `<script>`, alt text is non-empty, and there are no absolute or backslash paths.

## ASSET_ISSUES rows added

| File | Embedded in | What the SVG says | Why it is a problem |
|---|---|---|---|
| assets/i24_02_e1ea38ee.svg | 27 | "highWaterMark (default 16 KB)" | 64 KiB since Node 22; contradicts corrected lessons 26/27 |
| assets/i62_01_f49bfdf5.svg | 65 | "FROM node:20" / "FROM node:20-slim" | Node 20 end-of-life 2026-04-30; lesson now uses `node:24` |
| assets/i06_01_94834faf.svg | 09 | "Macrotasks (one per turn)" | A phase runs all its callbacks per turn, draining microtasks after each |
| assets/i22_01_094ff453.svg | 25 | microtasks drain "Between every phase" | They drain after every callback (since Node 11) |
| assets/i02_02_ba74adeb.svg | 05 | "Node 20 LTS", "Node 18" | Both end-of-life; labels are dated |

## MISSING_DIAGRAMS rows added

| Lesson | Concept | What the diagram should show |
|---|---|---|
| 28 | Carrying an incomplete line across chunks | chunks → Transform with a `tail` slot and `StringDecoder`; rows out; `flush` at end |
| 62 | Pool behaviour when a worker dies mid-task | queue → idle → in-flight; `'error'`/`'exit'`; reject, remove, respawn, next job |
| 64 | Why a lock needs an owner token | A/B timeline: A's lock expires, B takes it, old `DEL` vs Lua compare-and-delete |
| 70 | Claim → work → done lifecycle | none → processing → done; processing → deleted (throw); stuck → re-claimed after lease |

## Notes

- **Caption style:** the one new figure (lesson 42) uses the requested `*Figure: … Look at: …*` caption. The kit's existing figures use a plain one-sentence caption after a blank line.
- **Folder permissions:** the kit folder was read-only (`dr-xr-xr-x`). With your approval it was made writable (`chmod u+w`) so the new report files could be created, and it was left writable. `assets/` and `PDF/` were not touched.
- **PDF copies:** the files in `PDF/` were not regenerated, so they no longer match the corrected Markdown.
- **Seen but left alone (out of scope for this pass):**
  - 8 scrape-broken `'\n'` string literals remain in lessons 04 (1), 27 (2), 30 (3), 33 (1) and 67 (1).
  - Unguarded `req.body.<field>` reads remain in example code in lessons 40 (`req.body.quantity`, `req.body.ref`) and 52 (`req.body.email`, `req.body.file`). Under Express 5 they throw a TypeError (500) when no body is sent.
  - Lesson 41 still uses `z.string().email()`, which is deprecated in Zod 4.
  - Lesson 64's lock retry recursion is unbounded.
  - Lesson 09's "at the same scheduling point" wording is a looser version of the scoping fixed in lesson 08.
