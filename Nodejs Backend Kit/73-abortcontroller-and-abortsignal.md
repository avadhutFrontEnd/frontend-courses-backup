## Why it matters

A promise has no `cancel()` method. Once you call `fetch()`, start a `readFile()` or spawn a child process, the work runs until it finishes on its own, even if nobody wants the result any more. Lesson 17 makes the same point about `Promise.race` and `Promise.all`: the losing branches keep running.

On a server that costs real resources. A user closes the browser tab, but your handler still runs five database queries, holds a pooled connection, and builds a response that is written to a dead socket. A request to a slow upstream service has no deadline, so one stuck dependency piles up open sockets until the process runs out of file descriptors. During shutdown, timers and child processes that nobody can stop keep the process alive past the orchestrator's grace period.

Node's answer is one standard object pair, `AbortController` and `AbortSignal`, taken from the web platform (the WHATWG DOM spec). Almost every async API in Node core accepts the signal as an option: `fetch`, `http.request`, `fs/promises`, `timers/promises`, `events.once`, `stream.pipeline`, `child_process`. Learn the pattern once and you can cancel all of them the same way.

## The concept, simply

Cancellation is split into two objects so that the code that *decides* to cancel is separate from the code that *does* the work.

- **`AbortController`** is the trigger. It has one property, `signal`, and one method, `abort(reason)`. Whoever holds the controller can cancel.
- **`AbortSignal`** is the read-only half you pass to the operations. It is an `EventTarget` with:
  - `signal.aborted`: `false` until `abort()` is called, then `true` forever;
  - `signal.reason`: `undefined` until abort, then the value passed to `abort(reason)`, or a `DOMException` named `AbortError` if no reason was given;
  - `signal.throwIfAborted()`: throws `signal.reason` if the signal is aborted, otherwise does nothing (added in v17.3.0);
  - an `'abort'` event, dispatched once, synchronously inside the `abort()` call.

A signal goes from "not aborted" to "aborted" once and never goes back. A second `abort()` call does nothing. Two static helpers create signals with no controller: `AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` aborts itself after `ms` milliseconds (added in v17.3.0), and `AbortSignal.any([s1, s2])` aborts as soon as any input signal aborts (added in v20.3.0). `AbortSignal.abort(reason)` returns a signal that is already aborted (added in v15.12.0). `AbortController` itself was added in v15.0.0 and stopped being experimental in v15.4.0. The optional `reason` argument was added in v17.2.0.

Because a signal is a plain object, one controller can be passed to many operations at once. One `abort()` call stops all of them:

          each promise rejects / each callback or 'error' gets an abort error
```

## How it works

1. **You create a controller** and pass `controller.signal` to one or more operations, usually as `{ signal }` in their options object.
2. **Each operation checks the signal when it starts.** If `signal.aborted` is already `true`, it fails right away without doing any I/O. If not, it registers an `'abort'` listener on the signal.
3. **Something calls `controller.abort(reason)`**: a user action, a deadline (`AbortSignal.timeout`), a client disconnect, or a shutdown hook. The signal sets `aborted = true`, stores `reason`, and dispatches `'abort'` to its listeners before `abort()` returns.
4. **Each listener stops its own work.** `fetch` and `http.request` destroy the socket. `fs/promises.readFile` stops between chunk reads. `timers/promises.setTimeout` clears its timer. `pipeline` destroys every stream in the chain. `spawn` sends the child `killSignal` (default `'SIGTERM'`).
5. **The operation reports the abort as an error.** A promise rejects, a callback receives an `err`, or an emitter emits `'error'`. The error's shape depends on the API (see below).
6. **Operations that already finished are not affected.** Abort only stops work that is still pending. A well-written operation also removes its `'abort'` listener when it finishes normally, so a long-lived signal does not collect listeners.

**The error you get depends on the API.** This is the most common source of confusion. On Node v24.19.0:

- **`fetch`** (built on undici 7.29.0) rejects with **`signal.reason` itself**. With no reason that is a `DOMException` with `name === 'AbortError'` and numeric `code === 20`. With `AbortSignal.timeout` it is a `DOMException` with `name === 'TimeoutError'` and `code === 23`. With `abort(new Error('x'))` it is your `Error`. With `abort('text')` it is the string.
- **Node core APIs** (`timers/promises`, `fs/promises`, `fs` callbacks, `events.once`, `stream.pipeline`, `http.request`, `child_process`) reject with **Node's own `AbortError`**: `err.name === 'AbortError'`, `err.code === 'ABORT_ERR'` (a string), `err instanceof Error` is `true`, `err instanceof DOMException` is `false`, and `err.cause` holds `signal.reason`. This holds even for `AbortSignal.timeout`, so these APIs never give you `'TimeoutError'` as `err.name`; you find it in `err.cause.name`.

So the reliable test "was this an abort?" is not `err.name`. It is `signal.aborted`, checked on the signal you passed. `signal.reason` then tells you *why*.

**Listener cleanup.** An `AbortSignal` is an `EventTarget`, so listeners stay attached until they run or are removed. A signal that lives for the whole process (a shutdown signal, for example) and is passed to thousands of short operations will hold a closure for each one unless each operation removes its listener when it finishes. `{ once: true }` removes the listener after it runs, but it does not remove a listener that never runs. You still need `removeEventListener` on the success path, or `events.addAbortListener(signal, listener)` (added in v20.5.0, stable since v24.0.0), which returns a `Disposable` whose `[Symbol.dispose]()` removes the listener.

**Detecting a client disconnect in Express.** On Express 5.2.1 with Node v24.19.0, listen to `res.on('close')` and check `res.writableEnded`. `'close'` on the response fires both when the response finished and when the connection died first. `res.writableEnded` is `true` only if your code called `res.end()` (which `res.send`/`res.json` do), so `!res.writableEnded` inside the handler means "the client left before we answered". Do not use `req.on('close')`: the request stream (`http.IncomingMessage`) emits `'close'` when the request has been completed, meaning its *body* has been consumed, not when the socket closes (changed in v16.0.0). So after `express.json()` reads a POST body it fires right away, while the client is still waiting (Example 9 shows this).

## Code examples

**Example 1 — the controller, the signal, and the `'abort'` event.**

javascript

```
const controller = new AbortController();
const { signal } = controller;           // the read-only half you hand out

console.log('before:', signal.aborted, signal.reason);

signal.addEventListener('abort', () => {
  console.log('  abort event runs inside abort(), reason =', signal.reason.message);
}, { once: true });

console.log('calling abort()');
controller.abort(new Error('user cancelled'));
console.log('abort() returned');
console.log('after:', signal.aborted, signal.reason.message);

controller.abort(new Error('second call'));   // ignored: a signal aborts only once
console.log('reason unchanged:', signal.reason.message);

try {
  signal.throwIfAborted();
} catch (err) {
  console.log('throwIfAborted() threw signal.reason itself:', err === signal.reason);
}

// abort() with no argument: Node fills in a DOMException named AbortError
const c2 = new AbortController();
c2.abort();
const r = c2.signal.reason;
console.log(r instanceof DOMException, r.name, r.code, r.message);

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   before: false undefined
//   calling abort()
//     abort event runs inside abort(), reason = user cancelled
//   abort() returned
//   after: true user cancelled
//   reason unchanged: user cancelled
//   throwIfAborted() threw signal.reason itself: true
//   true AbortError 20 This operation was aborted
```

The `'abort'` listener runs inside the `abort()` call, before the next line. The second `abort()` is ignored, so the first reason wins. With no argument, Node supplies a `DOMException` named `AbortError` (legacy numeric `code` 20).

**Example 2 — `AbortSignal.timeout` and `AbortSignal.any`.**

javascript

```
// 1. AbortSignal.timeout: aborts itself after the delay with a TimeoutError
const t = AbortSignal.timeout(50);
t.addEventListener('abort', () => {
  const r = t.reason;
  console.log('timeout fired:', r instanceof DOMException, r.name, r.code, r.message);
}, { once: true });

// 2. AbortSignal.any: one signal that aborts when ANY input aborts
const user = new AbortController();
const combined = AbortSignal.any([user.signal, AbortSignal.timeout(1000)]);
setTimeout(() => user.abort(new Error('user pressed cancel')), 100);
combined.addEventListener('abort', () => {
  console.log('combined aborted, reason:', combined.reason.message);
  console.log('reason is the same object:', combined.reason === user.signal.reason);
}, { once: true });

// 3. If an input is already aborted, any() returns an already-aborted signal
const already = AbortSignal.any([AbortSignal.abort('gone'), new AbortController().signal]);
console.log('already aborted:', already.aborted, JSON.stringify(already.reason));

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   already aborted: true "gone"
//   timeout fired: true TimeoutError 23 The operation was aborted due to timeout
//   combined aborted, reason: user pressed cancel
//   reason is the same object: true
```

`AbortSignal.any` copies the reason of the input that aborted first, as the same object. If an input is already aborted, the result is already aborted, so `already aborted` prints first, during synchronous code. The timer behind `AbortSignal.timeout` does not keep the process alive on its own: a script whose only pending work is a 5-second `AbortSignal.timeout` exited in 0.06 s in a separate run (`/usr/bin/time node unref.mjs` → `0.06 s elapsed`).

**Example 3 — deadlines and cancel buttons for `fetch` and `http.request` against a local server.**

javascript

```
import http from 'node:http';
import { once } from 'node:events';

// A local server that takes 2 s to answer and logs when the client hangs up.
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => res.end('slow answer'), 2000);
  res.on('close', () => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    console.log(`server: ${req.url} closed, response finished = ${res.writableFinished}`);
  });
});
server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1');
await once(server, 'listening');
const base = `http://127.0.0.1:${server.address().port}`;

// fetch: the signal goes in the init object
const t0 = Date.now();
try {
  await fetch(`${base}/fetch`, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(100) });
} catch (err) {
  console.log(`fetch rejected after ~${Math.round((Date.now() - t0) / 100) * 100} ms:`, err.name, err.message);
}

// http.request / http.get: the signal goes in the options object
const ac = new AbortController();
const req = http.get(`${base}/http`, { signal: ac.signal }, (res) => res.resume());
req.on('error', (err) => console.log('http.get error:', err.name, err.code, '| cause:', err.cause));
setTimeout(() => ac.abort('client gave up'), 100);

await new Promise((r) => req.on('close', r)); // not once(): it rejects on 'error'
await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 50)); // let the server log its side
server.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   fetch rejected after ~100 ms: TimeoutError The operation was aborted due to timeout
//   server: /fetch closed, response finished = false
//   http.get error: AbortError ABORT_ERR | cause: client gave up
//   server: /http closed, response finished = false
```

Both clients close their socket, so the server's `res` emits `'close'` with `writableFinished === false` and the server clears its timer. Note the different error shapes: `fetch` rejects with the `TimeoutError` `DOMException` that `AbortSignal.timeout` stored as the reason, while `http.get` emits Node's `AbortError` and puts your reason (`'client gave up'`) in `err.cause`. Do not wait for the request with `events.once(req, 'close')`: `once` rejects when the emitter emits `'error'`, and an aborted request does.

**Example 4 — one signal fans out to four core APIs (local file only).**

javascript

```
import { setTimeout as sleep } from 'node:timers/promises';
import { readFile, writeFile, rm } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { once, EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
import { pipeline } from 'node:stream/promises';
import { Readable, Writable } from 'node:stream';

await writeFile('big.bin', Buffer.alloc(200 * 1024 * 1024)); // 200 MiB local file

const ac = new AbortController();
const { signal } = ac;

// An endless source: it only stops when something destroys the pipeline.
async function* ticks() { for (let i = 0; ; i++) { yield `tick ${i}\n`; await sleep(5); } }
const sink = new Writable({ write(chunk, enc, cb) { cb(); } });

const jobs = {
  'timers/promises setTimeout': sleep(60_000, 'done', { signal }),
  'fs/promises readFile':       readFile('big.bin', { signal }),
  'events.once':                once(new EventEmitter(), 'ready', { signal }),
  'stream/promises pipeline':   pipeline(Readable.from(ticks()), sink, { signal }),
};

setTimeout(() => ac.abort(), 10);   // one call cancels all four

const results = await Promise.allSettled(Object.values(jobs));
Object.keys(jobs).forEach((name, i) => {
  const { status, reason: e } = results[i];
  console.log(`${name.padEnd(27)} ${status}: ${e.name} code=${e.code}`);
});
console.log('sink destroyed by pipeline:', sink.destroyed);
await rm('big.bin');

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   timers/promises setTimeout  rejected: AbortError code=ABORT_ERR
//   fs/promises readFile        rejected: AbortError code=ABORT_ERR
//   events.once                 rejected: AbortError code=ABORT_ERR
//   stream/promises pipeline    rejected: AbortError code=ABORT_ERR
//   sink destroyed by pipeline: true
```

A 200 MiB read takes longer than 10 ms, so `readFile` is still reading when the signal fires and stops between chunks. `pipeline` destroys every stream it manages, which is why `sink.destroyed` is `true`. All four rejections are Node's `AbortError` with the string code `'ABORT_ERR'`.

**Example 5 — `child_process.spawn` with a signal and a custom `killSignal`.**

javascript

```
import { spawn } from 'node:child_process';

const ac = new AbortController();
// A child that would run for 30 s on its own
const child = spawn(process.execPath, ['-e', 'setTimeout(() => {}, 30_000)'], {
  signal: ac.signal,
  killSignal: 'SIGINT',            // default is 'SIGTERM'
});

child.on('error', (err) => console.log('error event:', err.name, err.code));
child.on('exit', (code, sig) => console.log('exit event: code =', code, '| signal =', sig, '| child.killed =', child.killed));

setTimeout(() => ac.abort(), 100);

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   error event: AbortError ABORT_ERR
//   exit event: code = null | signal = SIGINT | child.killed = true
```

When the signal aborts, Node sends the child `killSignal` (`'SIGTERM'` unless you set it; the option was added in v15.11.0), emits `'error'` with an `AbortError`, and then emits `'exit'` with `code === null` and the signal name. `exec`, `execFile` and `fork` take the same `signal` option (a separate run of `fork` with a signal printed `fork error AbortError ABORT_ERR` and `exit null SIGTERM`).

**Example 6 — writing your own abortable function, with listener cleanup.**

javascript

```
import { getEventListeners } from 'node:events';

// An abortable "work" function: resolves after ms, or rejects with the signal's reason.
function work(ms, { signal } = {}) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    signal?.throwIfAborted();                 // 1. refuse to start if already aborted

    const onAbort = () => {                   // 3. on abort: stop the work, reject
      clearTimeout(timer);
      reject(signal.reason);
    };
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {          // 2. the real work
      signal?.removeEventListener('abort', onAbort);  // 4. finished: drop the listener
      resolve(`worked ${ms} ms`);
    }, ms);
    signal?.addEventListener('abort', onAbort, { once: true });
  });
}

const ac = new AbortController();

// Many calls that finish normally, all sharing one long-lived signal
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) await work(1, { signal: ac.signal });
console.log('listeners left after 20 finished calls:', getEventListeners(ac.signal, 'abort').length);

// A call that gets cancelled
setTimeout(() => ac.abort(new Error('shutdown')), 20);
try { await work(1000, { signal: ac.signal }); }
catch (err) { console.log('cancelled with:', err.message); }

// A call made with a signal that is already aborted
try { await work(10, { signal: ac.signal }); }
catch (err) { console.log('refused to start:', err.message); }

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   listeners left after 20 finished calls: 0
//   cancelled with: shutdown
//   refused to start: shutdown
```

The four numbered steps are the whole pattern: refuse to start on an aborted signal, start the work, on abort undo the work and reject with `signal.reason`, and on success remove the listener. Leave out step 4 and the listeners pile up on the shared signal. `{ once: true }` does not help here, because these listeners never run:

javascript

```
import { getEventListeners } from 'node:events';

// Same function WITHOUT step 4: the listener stays on the signal after success
function leakyWork(ms, { signal }) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const timer = setTimeout(resolve, ms);
    signal.addEventListener('abort', () => { clearTimeout(timer); reject(signal.reason); }, { once: true });
  });
}

const ac = new AbortController();
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) await leakyWork(1, { signal: ac.signal });
console.log('listeners left after 20 finished calls:', getEventListeners(ac.signal, 'abort').length);

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   listeners left after 20 finished calls: 20
```

No warning was printed in this run, so nothing tells you about the leak. Each leftover listener keeps its closure (here the timer and the `reject` function) alive for as long as the signal lives.

**Example 7 — `events.addAbortListener`: a listener you can dispose of.**

javascript

```
import { addAbortListener, getEventListeners } from 'node:events';

const ac = new AbortController();

// Returns a Disposable; calling [Symbol.dispose]() removes the listener.
const disposable = addAbortListener(ac.signal, () => console.log('listener A ran'));
console.log('typeof dispose:', typeof disposable[Symbol.dispose]);
console.log('listeners:', getEventListeners(ac.signal, 'abort').length);
disposable[Symbol.dispose]();
console.log('after dispose:', getEventListeners(ac.signal, 'abort').length);

// It still runs a listener added to an ALREADY-aborted signal (addEventListener does not)
const dead = AbortSignal.abort();
dead.addEventListener('abort', () => console.log('addEventListener on aborted signal ran'));
addAbortListener(dead, () => console.log('addAbortListener on aborted signal ran'));
console.log('sync code done');

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   typeof dispose: function
//   listeners: 1
//   after dispose: 0
//   sync code done
//   addAbortListener on aborted signal ran
```

`addAbortListener` returns a `Disposable`, so in Node 24 you can also write `using sub = addAbortListener(signal, onAbort);` and the listener is removed when the block exits. It has one more difference from `addEventListener`: given a signal that is already aborted, it still calls the listener (on a later tick, after `sync code done`), while `addEventListener` never fires for an `'abort'` that already happened.

**Example 8 — cancelling the losing branches of `Promise.race`.**

javascript

```
import http from 'node:http';
import { once } from 'node:events';

// One local server that plays three "mirrors" with different speeds.
const delays = { '/a': 300, '/b': 50, '/c': 600 };
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => res.end(`answer from ${req.url}`), delays[req.url]);
  res.on('close', () => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    console.log(`server ${req.url}: ${res.writableFinished ? 'sent its answer' : 'client hung up, work stopped'}`);
  });
});
server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1');
await once(server, 'listening');
const base = `http://127.0.0.1:${server.address().port}`;

async function fastest(paths) {
  const ac = new AbortController();
  try {
    return await Promise.race(paths.map(async (p) => {
      const res = await fetch(base + p, { signal: ac.signal });
      return res.text();
    }));
  } finally {
    ac.abort(new Error('lost the race'));   // cancel every branch still running
  }
}

console.log('winner:', await fastest(['/a', '/b', '/c']));
await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 100));
server.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   server /b: sent its answer
//   winner: answer from /b
//   server /c: client hung up, work stopped
//   server /a: client hung up, work stopped
```

`Promise.race` settles with `/b`, and the `finally` block aborts the shared controller. The two `fetch` calls still in flight close their sockets, so the server stops the work for `/a` and `/c`. Without the abort, both would run to completion and their answers would be thrown away. The losers' rejections do not become unhandled rejections, because `Promise.race` has already attached handlers to every input.

**Example 9 — edge case: in Express 5, `req.on('close')` fires before the response is sent.**

The task: "stop working when the client disconnects". The obvious listener is `req.on('close')`. This probe (Express 5.2.1) logs both events for a POST with a JSON body, once when the client waits and once when it disconnects at 100 ms:

javascript

```
const express = require('express');               // express@5.2.1
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/slow', (req, res) => {
  const t0 = Date.now();
  const at = () => `~${String(Math.round((Date.now() - t0) / 100) * 100).padStart(3)} ms`;
  req.on('close', () => console.log(`  ${at()} req 'close'  (res.writableEnded=${res.writableEnded})`));
  res.on('close', () => console.log(`  ${at()} res 'close'  (res.writableEnded=${res.writableEnded})`));
  setTimeout(() => { if (!res.writableEnded) res.json({ ok: true }); }, 300);
});

const server = app.listen(4575, async () => {
  const send = (signal) => fetch('http://127.0.0.1:4575/slow', {
    method: 'POST', headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }, body: '{"a":1}', signal,
  }).then((r) => r.text());

  console.log('A: client waits for the full response');
  await send();
  console.log('B: client disconnects after 100 ms');
  await send(AbortSignal.timeout(100)).catch(() => {});
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 400));
  server.close();
});

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   A: client waits for the full response
//     ~  0 ms req 'close'  (res.writableEnded=false)
//     ~300 ms res 'close'  (res.writableEnded=true)
//   B: client disconnects after 100 ms
//     ~  0 ms req 'close'  (res.writableEnded=false)
//     ~100 ms res 'close'  (res.writableEnded=false)
```

In both cases `req` emits `'close'` at about 0 ms, as soon as `express.json()` has read the body. In case A the client is still waiting and gets its answer, so treating this as a disconnect would cancel a healthy request. `res` emits `'close'` at the real moment the connection ends, and `res.writableEnded` separates the two cases: `true` in A (we answered), `false` in B (the client left first). (In a separate run with a GET and no body, `req` emitted `'close'` only after the response or the disconnect, which is why this bug is easy to miss when you test with GET.)

**Example 10 — wiring it up: a per-request signal in Express 5.2.1.**

javascript

```
const express = require('express');               // express@5.2.1
const { setTimeout: sleep } = require('node:timers/promises');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// One AbortController per request, aborted when the client goes away early.
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const ac = new AbortController();
  res.on('close', () => {
    // 'close' also fires after a normal response; writableEnded tells them apart.
    if (!res.writableEnded) ac.abort(new Error('client disconnected'));
  });
  res.locals.signal = ac.signal;
  next();
});

app.post('/report', async (req, res) => {
  const { signal } = res.locals;
  try {
    for (let step = 1; step <= 5; step++) {
      await sleep(100, null, { signal });          // stands in for one slow query

    }
    res.json({ ok: true, rows: req.body.rows });

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   client 1 waits for the answer

//   server: step 2 done
//   server: step 3 done
//   server: step 4 done
//   server: step 5 done

//   client 2: TimeoutError
//   server: stopped early (client disconnected)
```

The middleware creates a controller per request and aborts it from `res.on('close')` only when `res.writableEnded` is `false`. The handler passes `res.locals.signal` to every slow call, so client 2's request stops after two of five steps instead of running all five for nobody.

**Example 11 — reason types: what you actually catch.**

javascript

```
import { setTimeout as sleep } from 'node:timers/promises';

for (const reason of [undefined, 'timeout!', null, 0, new Error('real error')]) {
  const signal = AbortSignal.abort(reason);       // already aborted
  const shown = (v) => v instanceof Error ? `${v.constructor.name}(${v.name}: ${v.message})` : JSON.stringify(v);

  // fetch hands back the reason itself (fails before any network I/O)
  const f = await fetch('http://127.0.0.1:9/', { signal }).catch((e) => e);
  // timers/promises wraps it: AbortError with the reason in .cause
  const t = await sleep(10, null, { signal }).catch((e) => e);

  console.log(`abort(${reason instanceof Error ? 'new Error(...)' : JSON.stringify(reason)})`);
  console.log('   signal.reason   :', shown(signal.reason));
  console.log('   fetch rejects   :', shown(f));
  console.log('   sleep rejects   :', shown(t), '| cause:', shown(t.cause));
}

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   abort(undefined)
//      signal.reason   : DOMException(AbortError: This operation was aborted)
//      fetch rejects   : DOMException(AbortError: This operation was aborted)
//      sleep rejects   : AbortError(AbortError: The operation was aborted) | cause: DOMException(AbortError: This operation was aborted)
//   abort("timeout!")
//      signal.reason   : "timeout!"
//      fetch rejects   : "timeout!"
//      sleep rejects   : AbortError(AbortError: The operation was aborted) | cause: "timeout!"
//   abort(null)
//      signal.reason   : null
//      fetch rejects   : null
//      sleep rejects   : AbortError(AbortError: The operation was aborted) | cause: null
//   abort(0)
//      signal.reason   : 0
//      fetch rejects   : 0
//      sleep rejects   : AbortError(AbortError: The operation was aborted) | cause: 0
//   abort(new Error(...))
//      signal.reason   : Error(Error: real error)
//      fetch rejects   : Error(Error: real error)
//      sleep rejects   : AbortError(AbortError: The operation was aborted) | cause: Error(Error: real error)
```

`fetch` passes the reason through untouched, so `abort('timeout!')` makes `fetch` reject with a string, and `abort(null)` makes it reject with `null`. A `catch (err) { log(err.message) }` then throws a `TypeError` of its own on `null`. Node core APIs always wrap the reason in an `AbortError` and expose it as `err.cause`. Only `undefined` is replaced by the default `DOMException`; `null` and `0` are stored as they are.

## Common mistakes & gotchas

- **Testing `err.name === 'AbortError'` to detect cancellation.** It works for Node core APIs, but `fetch` rejects with the reason itself, so after `abort(new Error('x'))` the name is `'Error'`, and after `AbortSignal.timeout` it is `'TimeoutError'`. Check `signal.aborted` on the signal you passed instead.
- **Expecting `err.code` to be the same everywhere.** Node's `AbortError` has `code === 'ABORT_ERR'` (a string). A `DOMException` has a legacy numeric `code`: `20` for `AbortError`, `23` for `TimeoutError`.
- **Expecting `TimeoutError` from core APIs.** With `AbortSignal.timeout`, `timers/promises`, `fs/promises`, `events.once`, `pipeline`, `http.request` and `child_process` all reject with `name === 'AbortError'`. The `TimeoutError` is in `err.cause`.
- **Aborting with a string or `null`.** `abort('stop')` stores a string as the reason. `fetch` rejects with that string, which has no stack and no `.message`. Pass an `Error` (or nothing).
- **Adding an `'abort'` listener to a signal that is already aborted.** `'abort'` is dispatched once. A listener added afterwards never runs, so the operation hangs forever. Check `signal.aborted` (or call `signal.throwIfAborted()`) first, or use `events.addAbortListener`, which calls the listener for an already-aborted signal.
- **Forgetting to remove the listener on success.** `{ once: true }` only removes a listener after it runs. On a long-lived signal, listeners from finished operations accumulate with no warning (Example 6).
- **Using `req.on('close')` in Express to detect a disconnect.** It fires once the request body has been read, which for a POST is before you respond. Use `res.on('close')` with `!res.writableEnded`.
- **Waiting with `events.once(req, 'close')` on an aborted request.** `events.once` rejects on `'error'`, and an aborted `http.request` emits `'error'` before `'close'`.
- **Assuming abort undoes work.** Abort stops pending I/O. A database write the server already committed stays committed. Cancellation saves resources; it is not a rollback.

## Best practices

- **Accept `{ signal }` in every async function you write** that does I/O or waits, and pass it down to every call inside. A signal that stops at the first layer cancels nothing below it.
- **Use `AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` for deadlines** instead of racing against a hand-made timer. It aborts the underlying work, and its timer does not keep the process alive.
- **Combine reasons with `AbortSignal.any`**: a request deadline plus a client-disconnect signal plus a process-shutdown signal, passed as one signal.
- **Abort with an `Error` that says why** (`new Error('client disconnected')`), so logs and `err.cause` carry a message and a stack.
- **Decide "cancelled or failed?" with `signal.aborted`**, then read `signal.reason` for the cause. Do not log a cancellation as a server error.
- **Clean up listeners** with `removeEventListener` on the success path, or with the `Disposable` from `events.addAbortListener`.
- **Abort the losers after `Promise.race` / `Promise.any`** in a `finally` block, with one controller shared by all branches.

## ⭐ Interview lens

> **Q: “Why are there two objects, `AbortController` and `AbortSignal`, instead of one?”**  
> A: They separate the right to cancel from the ability to observe cancellation. The controller has `abort()`; the signal only has `aborted`, `reason`, `throwIfAborted()` and the `'abort'` event. You give the signal to any number of operations and keep the controller, so a library you pass the signal to cannot cancel your other work. *Trap:* the signal is read-only; there is no `signal.abort()` instance method (only the static `AbortSignal.abort()` factory).

> **Q: “How do you put a 2-second deadline on a `fetch` and also let the user cancel it?”**  
> A: `fetch(url, { signal: AbortSignal.any([userController.signal, AbortSignal.timeout(2000)]) })`. `any` aborts when either input aborts and copies that input's reason, so a `TimeoutError` `DOMException` tells you it was the deadline and your own reason tells you it was the user.

> **Q: “A client closes the browser tab during a slow Express 5 request. How does the handler find out?”**  
> A: `res.on('close', () => { if (!res.writableEnded) controller.abort(...) })`, with the controller's signal passed to every slow call in the handler. `req.on('close')` is wrong: it fires once the request body is consumed, which for a POST is before the response. *Trap:* `'close'` on `res` also fires after a normal response, so the `writableEnded` check is required.

> **Q: “`Promise.race` returned the fastest of three requests. What happens to the other two?”**  
> A: They keep running; promises cannot be cancelled. To stop them, pass one shared signal to all three and call `controller.abort()` in a `finally` after the race settles. The loser requests then close their sockets and reject, and `race` has already attached handlers, so no unhandled rejection appears.

> **Q: “What does `timers/promises` reject with when you abort it with `new Error('stop')`?”**  
> A: Node's `AbortError`: `name 'AbortError'`, `code 'ABORT_ERR'`, an `Error` but not a `DOMException`, with your `Error` in `err.cause`. `fetch` with the same signal would reject with your `Error` itself.

## Cheat-card

- **Create:** `const ac = new AbortController(); op({ signal: ac.signal }); ac.abort(new Error('why'));`
- **Signal state:** `aborted` (bool, one-way), `reason` (any; default `DOMException` `AbortError`), `throwIfAborted()`, `'abort'` event fired synchronously inside `abort()`.
- **Factories:** `AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` (v17.3.0, `TimeoutError`, does not hold the process open), `AbortSignal.any([...])` (v20.3.0), `AbortSignal.abort(reason)` (already aborted).
- **Core APIs with `{ signal }`:** `fetch`, `http.request`, `fs.readFile` / `fs/promises`, `timers/promises`, `events.once`, `stream.pipeline`, `spawn` / `exec` / `execFile` / `fork`.
- **Errors:** `fetch` → `signal.reason` as is. Node core → `AbortError`, `code 'ABORT_ERR'`, reason in `err.cause`.
- **Detect cancel:** `signal.aborted`, not `err.name`.
- **Own functions:** check first → work → on abort undo + `reject(signal.reason)` → on success remove the listener.
- **Already aborted:** `addEventListener('abort')` never fires; `events.addAbortListener` (v20.5.0, stable v24.0.0) does.
- **Express disconnect:** `res.on('close')` + `!res.writableEnded`; not `req.on('close')`.
- **Race:** abort the shared controller in `finally` to stop the losers.
