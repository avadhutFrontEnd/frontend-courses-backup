# REPORT — Prompt 2 (foundations extension, 2026-10-07)

**Scope:**
- 7 new lessons: the missing intro slots 01–03, and 71–74 continuing the numbering.
- `## Additional topics` sections appended to 17 existing lessons, with new bullets added to each of their Cheat-cards.
- A new `README.md` index linking all 74 lessons. The kit had no index; creating one was approved.

**Environment:** Node **v24.19.0** (V8 13.6.233.17-node.51, libuv 1.52.1, undici 7.29.0), npm 11.17.0, Linux x64. Every code example was run in a scratch directory outside the kit, and outputs are pasted from those runs. Native tools went in `~/.cache/nodekit-repair-tools/pass2/`, because `/tmp` is noexec. Comparison runtimes were run through `npx node@…`.

**Libraries and tools:**

**Totals:**
- 18 `> ⚠️ Unverified` lines, each in the lesson next to the claim it qualifies. All are for things this machine could not run:
  - macOS or Windows commands;
  - Docker or Kubernetes;
  - a browser view;
  - CI publishing;
  - Nx;
  - `changeset publish`;
  - one reason that isn't documented.
- No output was pasted without being run.

**Coordinator checks:**
- **Append-only:** a script diffed the 17 appended lessons against snapshots taken before writing. The only changes are inserted Cheat-card bullets and the appended tail; no existing line changed.
- **Template:** all 7 new lessons have the 9 template sections in order and 5 Q&A each.
- **Line endings:** all files use CRLF.
- **Marketing words:** none, in the new lessons or the appendices.
- **Independent re-run:** I re-ran a sample of 6 blocks myself. 5 match the pasted output exactly: lessons 02, 17, 19, 25 and 73. The sixth, the `--watch` driver in lesson 72, needs its companion files; Writer D re-ran it as saved.

**Final link and index check (step 6):** see the end of this file.

## ASSET_ISSUES rows added

| File | Embedded in | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| assets/i09_01_73d3711b.svg | 12 | Low severity. "Load: import — asynchronous" and "Files: .js (default)" are now incomplete, because of `require(esm)` (v22.12.0 / v20.19.0) and ESM syntax detection (v22.7.0 / v20.19.0). It was not embedded in lesson 11 for this reason. |

## MISSING_DIAGRAMS rows added (15)

| Lesson | Concept |
|---|---|
| 01 | Process lifecycle |
| 01 | Release-line schedule |
| 02 | Compile tiers |
| 02 | Heap generations and GC |
| 02 | Hidden classes and IC states |
| 03 | PATH lookup and version switching |
| 04 (appendix) | Graceful SIGTERM shutdown timeline |
| 06/09 (appendices) | CJS vs ESM entry drain order |
| 09 (appendix) | Thenable resolution ticks |
| 13 (appendix) | Symlinks and the pnpm layout |
| 20 (appendix) | `events.on` async iterator |
| 72 | SEA build |
| 73 | One controller fanning a signal out |
| 74 | npm vs pnpm vs Yarn PnP layout |
| 74 | Turborepo cache key |

The full "what the diagram should show" text for each row is in MISSING_DIAGRAMS.md.

## Found but not changed (outside this prompt)

The writers found these in existing text. This prompt only allowed appending, so the original lines were left as they are. Where an appendix covers the point, it says so.

- **05:** "odd-numbered versions are short-lived / even = LTS". Node's previous-releases page states an annual cycle from Node 27, which makes this wrong.
- **09:**
  - "at the same scheduling point, nextTick beats promise" (and the matching interview answer) only holds for CJS top-level code and macrotask callbacks.
  - Example 4's output is correct only as a `.cjs` file.
  - The 09 appendix shows the `.mjs` results.
- **10, Example 3:** "a healthy idle service shows p99 well under a few ms" is wrong with `resolution: 20`. Measured on an idle loop: min 19.12 / p50 20.25 / max 21.00 ms. The 10 appendix explains why.
- **16:** "ahead of promise microtasks" (in How it works and in the table) is close to the nextTick wording that CORRECTIONS.md scopes.
- **04, Example 4:** a scrape-broken `'\n'` string literal, already listed in REPORT-PROMPT-1.

## Side effects outside the kit

- **Package caches:** pnpm created a store at `/tmp/.pnpm-store`. One early Yarn 4 run wrote a package cache under `~/.yarn/berry/cache` (`~/.yarn` already existed). Both are caches only and can be deleted.
- **Throwaway tools and installs:** these live under `~/.cache/nodekit-repair-tools/pass2/`.
- **Unchanged:** the real npm prefix, `~/.npmrc`, shell rc files and git config.
- **Processes:** none left running.
