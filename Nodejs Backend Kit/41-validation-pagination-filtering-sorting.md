## Why it matters

Every input to your API is a potential attack, a potential crash, and a potential data-corruption bug. "Never trust the client" is the first law of backend engineering, and **validation** is how you enforce it. An endpoint that reads `req.body.age` and stores it without checking will happily accept `"age": "banana"`, `"age": -5`, or a 10-megabyte string designed to exhaust your memory. Validation at the edge is what turns a fragile endpoint into a robust one, and it is the single highest-leverage habit separating hobby code from production code.

**Pagination** is equally load-bearing but for a different reason: scale. An endpoint that returns *all* users works fine with 100 rows and takes your database down with 10 million. `GET /users` without pagination is one of the most common causes of production incidents, because it passes every test on a small dev database and detonates in production. Interviewers ask "how would you paginate this?" precisely because the naive answer (offset/limit) has a subtle scaling flaw that only shows up at volume, and knowing the cursor-based alternative signals real experience.

Filtering and sorting round out the read story: real clients need `?status=active&sort=-createdAt`, and doing this cleanly — without opening a SQL-injection hole or letting clients sort by an unindexed column — is a craft worth knowing.

## The concept, simply

**Validation** means checking, at the boundary of your system, that incoming data has the right shape, types, and constraints *before* any business logic touches it. You declare a *schema* — "email must be a valid email, age must be an integer 0–150, role must be one of admin/user" — and a validation library checks the request against it, rejecting bad input with a clear error.

![Request flowing through validate step into controller with a fail branch to 422](assets/i38_01_5fdc1a01.svg)

Validate at the edge. Clean, typed data reaches your controller; invalid input is rejected early with 422.

Three libraries dominate the Node ecosystem: **Joi** (mature, chainable, framework-agnostic), **Zod** (TypeScript-first, infers static types from the schema — currently the most popular in new code), and **express-validator** (middleware built around express and the validator.js rules). They differ in ergonomics but share the idea: define the schema once, validate against it, get typed and coerced data out.

**Pagination** means returning results in bounded chunks instead of all at once. There are two families: *offset-based* (`?page=3&limit=20`) and *cursor-based* (`?after=<opaque-cursor>`). **Filtering** narrows results by field values (`?status=active`); **sorting** orders them (`?sort=-createdAt` for newest first).

## How it works (deep)

**Validation as a gate.** The correct architecture is a validation *middleware* that runs before the controller. It parses the request against the schema; on success it stores the *coerced, stripped* value (unknown keys removed, `"25"` turned into `25`) in `res.locals.validated` — not back onto `req`, because in Express 5 `req.query` is a getter and cannot be reassigned (changed in v5); on failure it short-circuits with a 422 and a list of what was wrong. The controller then trusts its input completely — no defensive `if (typeof x !== 'number')` scattered through business logic. This separation is the whole win: validation lives in one declarative place, not smeared across every handler.

A subtle but important point: **validate query and params too, not just the body**. `?limit=999999` or `?limit=abc` must be caught. A common bug is validating the JSON body carefully while blindly trusting `req.query.limit`, then passing it straight to the database as a `LIMIT`. Always coerce and clamp pagination params.

**Offset pagination** is the intuitive one: `LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40` skips 40 rows and returns the next 20. It lets clients jump to any page and is trivial to implement. It has two real flaws at scale.

![Side by side of offset pagination and cursor pagination with pros and cons](assets/i38_02_a09365f2.svg)

Offset is simple but slows down and drifts at scale; cursor pagination is fast and stable but can't jump to arbitrary pages.

Flaw one: *performance*. `OFFSET 1000000` forces the database to walk and discard a million rows before returning your twenty — it gets linearly slower the deeper you page. Flaw two: *drift*. If a new row is inserted while a user pages through results, the offsets shift, so they can see a row twice or skip one entirely. For a stable, high-volume feed this is unacceptable.

**Cursor (keyset) pagination** fixes both. Instead of "skip N rows," you say "give me rows *after* this specific point," where the point is encoded in an opaque cursor (often a base64 of the last row's sort key + id). The query becomes `WHERE (created_at, id) < (:cursor_ts, :cursor_id) ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC LIMIT 20`. Because it uses an index seek rather than a scan-and-discard, it stays fast no matter how deep you go, and because it anchors to a real row rather than a numeric offset, inserts don't cause skips or repeats. The trade-off: you cannot jump to "page 47" — only forward/backward from where you are. That is fine for infinite-scroll feeds and the reason Twitter, Slack, and the GitHub API all use cursors.

**Filtering and sorting safely.** The danger is letting arbitrary client strings reach your query. Never interpolate `req.query.sort` into raw SQL — that is an injection hole. Instead, maintain an *allow-list*: map the client's `?sort=-createdAt` to a known column and direction, and reject anything not on the list. Same for filters — validate field names against a whitelist and use parameterized queries or your ORM's query builder for the values. Also restrict sorting to *indexed* columns; letting a client sort a ten-million-row table by an unindexed field is a self-inflicted denial of service.

## Code examples

A reusable Zod validation middleware — declare the schema once, get clean data or a 422.

javascript

```
const { z } = require('zod');

// Generic middleware: validate a chosen part of the request
function validate(schema, source = 'body') {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    const result = schema.safeParse(req[source]);
    if (!result.success) {
      return res.status(422).json({
        error: 'Validation failed',
        details: result.error.issues.map(i => ({
          field: i.path.join('.'),
          message: i.message,
        })),
      });
    }
    // coerced + stripped — controller trusts this. Don't write it back to req[source]:
    // in Express 5 req.query is a getter, so the assignment throws (ESM/strict) or is ignored.
    res.locals.validated = { ...res.locals.validated, [source]: result.data };
    next();
  };
}

const createUserSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  age: z.coerce.number().int().min(0).max(150),
  role: z.enum(['admin', 'user']).default('user'),
}).strict(); // reject unknown keys

router.post('/users', validate(createUserSchema), createUser); // createUser reads res.locals.validated.body
```

Validating and clamping pagination query params so a client can never demand a million rows:

javascript

```
const pageQuerySchema = z.object({
  page:  z.coerce.number().int().min(1).default(1),
  limit: z.coerce.number().int().min(1).max(100).default(20), // hard ceiling
  sort:  z.string().optional(),
  status: z.enum(['active', 'inactive']).optional(),
});

router.get('/users', validate(pageQuerySchema, 'query'), listUsers);

// Real output, GET /users with no query string (Express 5.2.1, Zod 4.6.5, Node v24.19.0):
//   old `req[source] = result.data`, CommonJS → 200 {"skip":null,"typeofPage":"undefined"}  (assignment silently ignored)
//   old `req[source] = result.data`, ESM      → 500 "Cannot set property query of #<IncomingMessage> which has only a getter"
//   res.locals.validated                      → 200 {"page":1,"limit":20,"skip":0,"typeofPage":"number"}
```

> **Why this was wrong:** the earlier version wrote the parsed data back with `req[source] = result.data`. That worked for `req.query` in Express 4, but Express 5 defines `req.query` as a getter, so the defaults and coercion were lost (or the request crashed in strict-mode code).

Offset pagination with a metadata envelope so clients know how to navigate:

javascript

```
async function listUsers(req, res) {
  const { page, limit, status } = res.locals.validated.query; // numbers, defaults applied
  const filter = status ? { status } : {};

  const [items, total] = await Promise.all([
    User.find(filter).skip((page - 1) * limit).limit(limit),
    User.countDocuments(filter),
  ]);

  res.json({
    data: items,
    pagination: {
      page, limit, total,
      totalPages: Math.ceil(total / limit),
      hasNext: page * limit < total,
    },
  });
}
```

Cursor pagination with safe, allow-listed sorting — the version you reach for at scale:

javascript

```
// Allow-list maps client tokens to real, indexed columns + direction
const SORTABLE = { createdAt: 'created_at', name: 'name' };

async function feed(req, res) {
  const limit = Math.min(Number(req.query.limit) || 20, 100);
  const cursor = req.query.after
    ? JSON.parse(Buffer.from(req.query.after, 'base64').toString())
    : null;

  // Keyset: fetch rows strictly "after" the cursor's (createdAt, id)
  const rows = await Post.findAfter(cursor, limit + 1); // +1 to detect more
  const hasMore = rows.length > limit;
  const page = rows.slice(0, limit);

  const last = page[page.length - 1];
  const nextCursor = hasMore
    ? Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({ createdAt: last.createdAt, id: last.id })).toString('base64')
    : null;

  res.json({ data: page, nextCursor });
}
```

## Common mistakes & gotchas

- **Only validating the body:** query and path params are input too. `?limit=99999999` and `/users/'; DROP TABLE` must be checked.
- **No upper bound on `limit`:** a client sending `?limit=1000000` can exhaust memory and stall the DB. Always clamp with a hard max.
- **Deep offset pagination:** `OFFSET 500000` is slow and drifts under concurrent inserts. Use cursors for large/real-time datasets.
- **Interpolating sort/filter fields into SQL:** a direct injection vulnerability. Allow-list field names; parameterize values.
- **Sorting on unindexed columns:** lets a client trigger full-table sorts — effectively a DoS.
- **Trusting client-coerced types:** `req.query.limit` is a *string*; `"20" - 1` works but `"20" + 1` is `"201"`. Coerce explicitly.
- **Leaking internal error detail:** return which fields failed, not stack traces or DB messages.
- **Validating in the controller by hand:** scatters rules and drifts. Centralize in schema middleware.

## Best practices

- Validate **every** input surface — body, query, params — with a declarative schema (Zod/Joi/express-validator) in middleware, before the controller.
- **Coerce and strip**: turn strings into the right types and remove unknown keys so the controller trusts its input.
- Return **422** with a structured list of field-level errors, never a stack trace.
- **Clamp pagination**: default and maximum `limit`, minimum `page`/positive cursor.
- Prefer **cursor pagination** for large or frequently-changing datasets; offset is fine for small, stable admin tables.
- **Allow-list** sortable and filterable fields, map them to indexed columns, and parameterize all values.
- Return a **consistent envelope** (`{ data, pagination }` or `{ data, nextCursor }`) so clients paginate uniformly.

## ⭐ Interview lens

> **Q: Where should validation happen, and why there?**  
> At the edge, in middleware before the controller, so invalid input never reaches business logic or the database. Centralizing it in a schema keeps rules in one declarative place and lets the controller trust coerced, stripped data. Validating inside handlers scatters and drifts.

> **Q: Offset vs cursor pagination — when and why?**  
> Offset (`page/limit`) is simple and allows jumping to any page but slows down at deep offsets (scan-and-discard) and drifts when rows are inserted mid-scroll. Cursor/keyset anchors to the last row's sort key, uses an index seek so it stays fast at any depth, and doesn't skip/repeat under inserts — but can't jump to arbitrary pages. Use cursors for large or real-time feeds.

> **Q: A client sends `?sort=passwordHash`. What's the risk and the fix?**  
> If you interpolate it into a query you get injection and you may expose or sort by sensitive/unindexed columns. Fix: an allow-list mapping client tokens to known indexed columns and directions, rejecting anything else, with parameterized queries for values.

> **Q: Which status code for a validation failure — 400 or 422?**  
> 422 Unprocessable Entity is more precise: the request parsed fine but failed semantic rules. 400 is for syntactically broken requests (unparseable JSON). Either is defensible if consistent, but 422 shows you know the distinction.

> **Q: Why cap `limit`, and what happens if you don't?**  
> Without a ceiling, a client can request millions of rows, exhausting server memory and stalling the DB — a trivial DoS. Always clamp with a sane default (e.g. 20) and hard max (e.g. 100).

> **Q: Zod vs Joi vs express-validator?**  
> All validate at the edge. Zod is TypeScript-first and infers static types from the schema (great for TS codebases). Joi is mature and framework-agnostic with a rich chainable API. express-validator integrates as express middleware around validator.js. Pick by ecosystem fit; the pattern — schema in middleware, 422 on failure — is identical.

## Cheat-card

- **Never trust the client.** Validate body + query + params with a schema in middleware, before the controller.
- **Coerce, strip, clamp:** types fixed, unknown keys removed, `limit` bounded.
- Validation fail → **422** with field-level details (no stack traces).
- **Offset** = `page/limit`: simple, jumps pages, but slow + drifts at scale.
- **Cursor/keyset** = "rows after X": fast at any depth, stable under inserts, no random jumps.
- **Allow-list** sort/filter fields → indexed columns; parameterize values (no SQL injection).
- Return a consistent envelope: `{ data, pagination }` or `{ data, nextCursor }`.
- Libraries: **Zod** (TS-first), **Joi** (mature), **express-validator** (middleware).
- **Same endpoint, three libraries:** Zod `safeParse` / Joi `validate(…, { abortEarly: false, stripUnknown: true })` / express-validator chains + `validationResult` + `matchedData`; all store into `res.locals.validated.query`.
- **express-validator on Express 5:** `.toInt()` etc. on `query` update `matchedData()` but not `req.query` (a re-parsing getter); the write-back is lost without an error. Body/params sanitizers still write back.
- **Repeated keys** (`?page=1&page=2`) arrive as arrays; guard with `.not().isArray().bail()` in express-validator.

## Additional topics

*Added 12 Oct 2026 · examples verified on Node v24.19.0 and Express 5.3.0 (Express 4.22.3 for one comparison run), Zod 4.6.5, Joi 18.2.9, express-validator 7.3.2, supertest 7.3.1*

### The same endpoint in Zod, Joi and express-validator

The Code examples above validate `GET /users` query parameters with Zod. Here the same endpoint is written with Joi and with express-validator, and the same inputs go through all three. All three versions follow the Express 5 rule from the "Validation as a gate" paragraph: the validated, coerced data goes to `res.locals.validated.query`, and nothing is written back to `req.query`.

The libraries differ in where the clean data comes from:

- **Zod:** `schema.safeParse(input)` returns `{ success, data | error }`. `z.coerce.number()` runs `Number(value)` before the checks. Unknown keys are dropped by default (`.strict()` rejects them instead).
- **Joi:** `schema.validate(input, options)` returns `{ value, error }`. `Joi.number()` converts numeric strings by default (`convert: true`). Unknown keys are an **error** by default (`"role" is not allowed`), so pass `stripUnknown: true` to match Zod. Pass `abortEarly: false` to get every failing field, not just the first.
- **express-validator:** each `query('page')…` call is a middleware *chain*. It records validators and sanitizers (`.default()`, `.toInt()`) and runs them on its own copy of each field. `validationResult(req)` returns the errors and `matchedData(req)` returns the sanitized values of the fields the chains declared. The chains also try to write the sanitized value back into `req.query`. On Express 5 that write is lost, as the second example shows.

How it works:

1. The Zod and Joi middlewares read `req.query` once, validate, and either answer 422 or store the result in `res.locals.validated.query`.
2. The express-validator version is an array: the four chains, then one middleware that calls `validationResult(req)`. On success it stores `matchedData(req, { locations: ['query'] })`.
3. The controller `listUsers` is shared. It reads only `res.locals.validated.query`, and also prints what `req.query.page` still holds.

**Example — Zod, Joi and express-validator on identical inputs.**

javascript

```
// three-validators.cjs: the lesson's GET /users query validation in Zod, Joi and express-validator.
// All three put the result in res.locals.validated.query and never write to req.query.
const express = require('express');
const request = require('supertest');
const { z } = require('zod');
const Joi = require('joi');
const { query, validationResult, matchedData } = require('express-validator');

// The same 422 body for all three libraries.
const fail = (res, details) => res.status(422).json({ error: 'Validation failed', details });
const store = (res, data) => { res.locals.validated = { ...res.locals.validated, query: data }; };

// --- Zod (the schema from the Code examples above)
const pageQuerySchema = z.object({
  page:  z.coerce.number().int().min(1).default(1),

  sort:  z.string().optional(),
  status: z.enum(['active', 'inactive']).optional(),
});
const zodQuery = (schema) => (req, res, next) => {
  const r = schema.safeParse(req.query);
  if (!r.success) return fail(res, r.error.issues.map((i) => ({ field: i.path.join('.'), message: i.message })));
  store(res, r.data);
  next();
};

// --- Joi: Joi.number() converts "2" to 2 by default (convert: true)
const pageQueryJoi = Joi.object({
  page:  Joi.number().integer().min(1).default(1),
  limit: Joi.number().integer().min(1).max(100).default(20),
  sort:  Joi.string(),
  status: Joi.string().valid('active', 'inactive'),
});
const joiQuery = (schema) => (req, res, next) => {
  // abortEarly:false -> report every field; stripUnknown -> drop extra keys like Zod does
  const { error, value } = schema.validate(req.query, { abortEarly: false, stripUnknown: true });
  if (error) return fail(res, error.details.map((d) => ({ field: d.path.join('.'), message: d.message })));
  store(res, value);
  next();
};

const pageQueryChains = [
  query('page').default(1).isInt({ min: 1 }).withMessage('page must be an integer >= 1').toInt(),
  query('limit').default(20).isInt({ min: 1, max: 100 }).withMessage('limit must be an integer 1-100').toInt(),
  query('sort').optional().isString(),
  query('status').optional().isIn(['active', 'inactive']).withMessage('status must be active or inactive'),
];
const evQuery = (chains) => [...chains, (req, res, next) => {
  const result = validationResult(req);
  if (!result.isEmpty()) return fail(res, result.array().map((e) => ({ field: e.path, message: e.msg })));
  store(res, matchedData(req, { locations: ['query'] })); // only the fields the chains validated
  next();
}];

// The controller is identical for all three.
function listUsers(req, res) {
  const { page, limit } = res.locals.validated.query;
  res.json({ ...res.locals.validated.query, skip: (page - 1) * limit, typeofPage: typeof page,
             reqQueryPage: req.query.page ?? null }); // what req.query still holds
}

const app = express();
app.get('/zod/users', zodQuery(pageQuerySchema), listUsers);
app.get('/joi/users', joiQuery(pageQueryJoi), listUsers);
app.get('/ev/users',  evQuery(pageQueryChains), listUsers);

const inputs = ['', '?page=2&limit=50&status=active&role=admin', '?limit=500', '?page=abc&status=deleted',
                '?page=', '?limit=1e1', '?page=1&page=2'];
(async () => {
  for (const qs of inputs) {
    console.log(`GET /users${qs || ' (no query)'}`);
    for (const lib of ['zod', 'joi', 'ev']) {
      const r = await request(app).get(`/${lib}/users${qs}`);
      console.log(`  ${lib.padEnd(3)} ${r.status} ${r.text}`);
    }
  }
})();

```

Reading the table:

- **No query, and normal input:** all three produce the same numbers (`page` and `limit` as numbers, defaults applied, `role` dropped). `reqQueryPage` is still the string `"2"` in every case: `req.query` keeps raw strings, and only `res.locals.validated.query` holds numbers.
- **`?limit=500`, `?page=abc&status=deleted`:** all three answer 422 with every failing field. Only the messages differ (the express-validator ones come from `.withMessage()`).
- **`?page=` (empty):** Zod coerces `""` to `0` (Too small) and Joi refuses an empty string as a number. express-validator's `.default(1)` replaces "an empty string, `null`, `undefined`, or `NaN`" (its docs), so it accepts the request as page 1.
- **`?limit=1e1`:** `Number('1e1')` is `10`, so Zod and Joi accept it. express-validator's `isInt` checks the string's characters and rejects it.
- **`?page=1&page=2`:** Express 5's simple query parser turns a repeated key into an array (lesson 35). Zod and Joi reject an array where a number is expected. express-validator runs standard validators and sanitizers on each array item, so the request passes with `page: [1, 2]` and `skip` becomes `NaN`, which JSON prints as `null`. The edge case below fixes it.

### express-validator sanitizers and the read-only `req.query` in Express 5

In Express 5, `req.query` is a getter on the request prototype: each read parses the URL's query string again and returns a **new** object (changed in v5; Express 4 parsed once and stored the object). express-validator 7 writes sanitized values back with lodash `_.set(req[location], path, value)`. For `query`, `req[location]` is a fresh, temporary object, so the write succeeds without an error and is then discarded. The value inside express-validator's own context is correct, and `matchedData()` returns it.

How it works:

1. The chain reads `req.query.page` (`'2'`) into its context.
2. `isInt` passes and `.toInt()` sets the context value to `2`.
3. It compares that with `req.query.page`, sees a difference and runs `_.set(req.query, 'page', 2)`. On Express 5 this sets `page` on the temporary object returned by that one read.
4. The next `req.query` read parses the URL again and returns `{ page: '2' }`.
5. `matchedData(req)` builds its result from the context, so it holds `2`.

**Example — does `.toInt()` change `req.query` on Express 5?**

// toint-writeback.cjs: does express-validator's .toInt() change req.query on Express 5?
const express = require('express');
const request = require('supertest');
const { query, matchedData } = require('express-validator');

const app = express();
app.get('/users',
  (req, res, next) => { res.locals.before = req.query; next(); },
  query('page').isInt({ min: 1 }).toInt(),   // sanitizer: '2' -> 2, then tries _.set(req.query, 'page', 2)
  (req, res) => res.json({
    express: require('express/package.json').version,
    sameObjectEachRead: req.query === req.query,
    before: res.locals.before,
    reqQueryAfter: req.query,
    typeofReqQueryPage: typeof req.query.page,
    matchedData: matchedData(req),
  }));

request(app).get('/users?page=2').then((r) => console.log(r.status, r.text));

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Express 5.3.0, express-validator 7.3.2):
//   200 {"express":"5.3.0","sameObjectEachRead":false,"before":{"page":"2"},"reqQueryAfter":{"page":"2"},"typeofReqQueryPage":"string","matchedData":{"page":2}}
```

Observed result: `.toInt()` does not throw and does not report anything. It works inside express-validator (`matchedData` has the number), but its write to `req.query` is silently lost. `req.query` returns a different object on every read (`sameObjectEachRead: false`) and still holds the string `"2"`. Running the same file on Express 4.22.3 prints `{"express":"4.22.3","sameObjectEachRead":true,"before":{"page":2},"reqQueryAfter":{"page":2},"typeofReqQueryPage":"number","matchedData":{"page":2}}`. There, the cached object really was mutated, including the `before` reference taken earlier. Code that relied on `req.query.page` being a number after `.toInt()` therefore breaks when moving to Express 5 without any error. Read `matchedData(req)` instead, as the shared example does. Sanitizers on `body` and `params` are not affected: `req.body` and `req.params` are ordinary properties in Express 5.

### Common mistakes & gotchas (additional topics)

- **Reading `req.query` after express-validator sanitizers on Express 5.** The values are still the original strings. Use `matchedData(req)`.
- **Joi rejecting harmless extra keys.** Joi forbids unknown keys by default. Pass `stripUnknown: true` (or `.unknown(true)` on the schema) if you want Zod's strip behaviour.
- **`abortEarly` left at its default.** Joi stops at the first error, so clients fix one field per round trip. Pass `abortEarly: false`.
- **express-validator `.default()` swallowing empty values.** `?page=` becomes the default, while Zod and Joi reject it. Decide which behaviour you want and keep it the same across endpoints.
- **Different "integer" rules.** Zod/Joi coerce with `Number()` (accepting `1e1`, ` 2 `); express-validator's `isInt` checks the text. Pick one library per API so the same input gets the same answer.

### Edge case worked through: a repeated query key with express-validator

With Express 5's default `"simple"` query parser, `?page=1&page=2` yields `page: ['1', '2']`. express-validator validates and sanitizes each array element, so `isInt().toInt()` succeeds and hands the controller an array. Guard single-value fields with `.not().isArray()` and `.bail()`, so later validators do not run once that check fails:

javascript

```
// ev-repeated.cjs: ?page=1&page=2 through express-validator, without and with a "single value" guard.
const express = require('express');
const request = require('supertest');
const { query, validationResult, matchedData } = require('express-validator');

const loose = query('page').default(1).isInt({ min: 1 }).toInt();
const strict = query('page').not().isArray().withMessage('page must appear once').bail()
  .default(1).isInt({ min: 1 }).withMessage('page must be an integer >= 1').toInt();

const report = (req, res) => {
  const errors = validationResult(req).array().map((e) => e.msg);
  res.status(errors.length ? 422 : 200).json(errors.length ? { errors } : matchedData(req));
};

const app = express();
app.get('/loose', loose, report);
app.get('/strict', strict, report);

(async () => {
  for (const qs of ['?page=1&page=2', '?page=3', '']) {
    for (const path of ['/loose', '/strict']) {
      const r = await request(app).get(path + qs);
      console.log(`${(path + qs).padEnd(22)} ${r.status} ${r.text}`);
    }
  }
})();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Express 5.3.0, express-validator 7.3.2):
//   /loose?page=1&page=2   200 {"page":[1,2]}
//   /strict?page=1&page=2  422 {"errors":["page must appear once"]}
//   /loose?page=3          200 {"page":3}
//   /strict?page=3         200 {"page":3}
//   /loose                 200 {"page":1}
//   /strict                200 {"page":1}
```

The guard turns the array into a 422 and leaves single values and the default unchanged. Zod and Joi need no guard, because an array is not a number to them (the `?page=1&page=2` row of the first example).

### ⭐ Interview lens (additional topics)

> **Q: “You move an app that uses express-validator's `.toInt()` from Express 4 to Express 5. What breaks?”**  
> A: Nothing throws, but `req.query` values stay strings. Express 5's `req.query` is a getter that re-parses the URL on every read, so express-validator's write-back lands on a throwaway object. The sanitized values are still available from `matchedData(req)`, so controllers should read that (or a copy stored in `res.locals`) instead of `req.query`. Body and params sanitizers still write back, because those are plain properties. *Trap:* "it throws 'Cannot set property query'". That only happens when code assigns `req.query = …` itself in strict mode.

> **Q: “Zod, Joi or express-validator — do they accept the same inputs?”**  
> A: Not exactly. In these runs `?page=` was rejected by Zod and Joi but defaulted to 1 by express-validator, and `?limit=1e1` was accepted by Zod and Joi but rejected by express-validator. A repeated key passed express-validator as an array. The pattern (schema in middleware, 422, clean data in `res.locals`) is the same; the edge semantics are not, so pick one per API and test the edges.
