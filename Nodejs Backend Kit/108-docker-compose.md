# Docker Compose: App, Postgres and Redis

*22 min read · Updated 12 Oct 2026 · Topic 108 of 117 · added to this kit, not part of the original course*

**Source:** written for this kit — examples verified on Node v24.19.0 and Docker Compose v5.6.0 (standalone binary, `docker-compose config` only), PostgreSQL 18.4 and Redis 8.0.5 run locally without Docker, Express 5.3.0, pg 8.23.1, ioredis 6.0.0. No Docker daemon was available, so no container was started.

## Why it matters

The orders API from lesson 107 needs PostgreSQL and Redis. Without Compose, every developer installs both by hand, at whatever versions their package manager has, with whatever passwords they picked. The README grows a list of `docker run` commands that must be typed in the right order. Common results:

- **The app starts before the database accepts connections.** It crashes on its first query, or worse, keeps running and returns 500s.
- **The schema is missing or half-applied.** Someone forgot to run the migration, or three app instances ran it at the same time.
- **Data disappears.** The database container was removed and its data lived inside it, or the volume was mounted at the wrong path.
- **"Works on my machine".** One laptop has Postgres 16 and Redis 7, CI has 18 and 8.

**Docker Compose** describes the whole stack in one YAML file (`compose.yaml`): which images to run, their environment, ports, volumes, networks, health checks and start order. `docker compose up` creates all of it. `docker compose down` removes it again, and leaves named volumes in place unless you add `-v`.

## The concept, simply

Each entry under `services:` becomes one or more containers. Compose puts them on a private network where each service is reachable by its name, so the app connects to `db:5432` and `cache:6379`, not to `localhost`. Data that must survive a container being recreated goes into a **named volume**.

The important part is the **start order**. "Started" is not "ready": a Postgres container is running long before it accepts connections. So each dependency gets a **health check**, and the app's `depends_on` waits for it:

text

```
docker compose up
  │
  ├─ 1. start db (postgres:18.4) and cache (redis:8.0.5) in parallel
  │       db health check:    pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -d app
  │       cache health check: redis-cli ping
  │       … wait until both report "healthy"            (condition: service_healthy)
  │
  ├─ 2. start migrate (same image as app) as soon as db is healthy; it does not wait for cache
  │       runs node dist/migrate.js once
  │       … wait until it exits with code 0   (condition: service_completed_successfully)
  │       exit code ≠ 0 → app is never started
  │
  ├─ 3. start app (node dist/server.js)
  │       app health check: fetch http://127.0.0.1:3000/readyz
  │       "healthy" once SELECT 1 and PING both succeed
  ▼
stack ready
```

The migration runs **once**, in its own short-lived container, before any app container starts. The app never migrates the schema itself.

## How it works

What `docker compose up` does, in order (from the Compose specification and Docker's documentation; the merge and interpolation steps are shown for real in Examples 3 to 5, the rest could not be run here):

1. **Find the files.** Without `-f`, Compose reads `compose.yaml` and, if it exists in the same directory, `compose.override.yaml`. With `-f a.yaml -f b.yaml`, it reads exactly those, in that order.
2. **Interpolate each file.** `${VAR}`, `${VAR:-default}` and `${VAR:?error}` are replaced with values from your shell environment, then from the `.env` file in the project directory. This happens per file, before merging.
3. **Merge the files.** Later files override earlier ones (rules below).
4. **Create the network and volumes.** Names are prefixed with the project name (`name: orders` → network `orders_backend`, volume `orders_pgdata`).
5. **Build or pull images.** Services with `build:` are built from their Dockerfile; others are pulled.
6. **Start services in dependency order.** `db` and `cache` first. Compose runs each health check every `interval` and waits for `healthy`. Failures during `start_period` do not count towards `retries`. Then `migrate` starts and Compose waits for it to exit with code 0. Then `app` starts. If a dependency becomes unhealthy or `migrate` exits non-zero, Compose does not start `app` and `up` fails.
7. **Keep watching.** The app's own health check keeps running. `restart: unless-stopped` restarts the app if its process exits. `migrate` has `restart: "no"`, so it stays exited.

> ⚠️ Unverified: steps 4 to 7, including the health-check timing, the exact error messages Compose prints, and restart behaviour. They need a Docker daemon, which was not available. The ordering logic itself is reproduced without Docker in Examples 6 and 7.

**Health checks.** A health check is a command run inside the container. Exit code 0 means healthy, 1 means unhealthy. `test` takes `["CMD", …]` (run directly) or `["CMD-SHELL", "…"]` (run through `/bin/sh`). Four details matter here:

- **Postgres: check over TCP.** The `postgres` image's entrypoint, on first start, runs a temporary server to create the database, started with `-c listen_addresses=''` (from `docker-entrypoint.sh`), so it listens only on the Unix socket. `pg_isready` with no `-h` checks that socket and can report ready during that phase, and then the server restarts. `pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1` checks TCP, which only the real server listens on.
- **Redis: `redis-cli ping`** prints `PONG` and exits 0 when the server answers.
- **The app: no curl.** `node:24-slim` does not contain curl. Its Dockerfile installs curl to download Node, then purges the build packages. The check uses Node's own `fetch` instead.
- **What "ready" means for the app.** `/readyz` returns 200 only when both `SELECT 1` and `PING` succeed (lesson 107, Example 1), so the app's health reflects its dependencies. Keep liveness (`/healthz`) dependency-free, as lesson 66 explains.

**`depends_on` conditions.** The long syntax takes `condition:` per dependency:

| Condition | Compose waits until the dependency… | Used here for |
|---|---|---|
| `service_started` (the short syntax's meaning) | has been started | nothing: started is not ready |
| `service_healthy` | reports `healthy` from its `healthcheck` | `db`, `cache` |
| `service_completed_successfully` | has run to completion and exited 0 | `migrate` |

Two more keys exist. `restart: true` (Compose v2.17.0+) restarts the dependent service when Compose itself restarts the dependency, for example with `docker compose restart db`. `required: false` (v2.20.0+) turns a missing dependency into a warning. `depends_on` only orders `docker compose up`. It does not help when Postgres restarts while the app is running, so the app still needs connection retries and a readiness endpoint.

**Volumes and networks.** `pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql` mounts the named volume `pgdata`. **For PostgreSQL 18 and later images the mount point changed**: `PGDATA` is now `/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker` and the image declares `VOLUME /var/lib/postgresql`. The image docs say mounts "should be targeted at the updated location". If you copy an older example that mounts `…/postgresql/data` on an 18 image, `PGDATA` (`/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker`) is outside your named volume, so the database files go into the anonymous volume the image declares, not into `pgdata`.

> ⚠️ Unverified: what then happens to the data when the stack is removed and recreated (`docker compose down` then `up`) was not tested; the image documentation describes the same trap for 17 and earlier as mounts that "WILL NOT PERSIST database data when the container is re-created".

Redis here runs with `--save '' --appendonly no`, a pure cache with nothing to persist. A Redis that must keep data needs a volume on `/data`. The `backend` network is a user-defined network. Services on it reach each other by service name. Only `ports:` entries are reachable from the host, which is why the dev override publishes the database on `127.0.0.1` only.

**`.env` interpolation vs `env_file`.** Two different mechanisms with similar names:

- **`.env` in the project directory** is read by **Compose** to fill in `${…}` in the YAML. Its values are not passed to containers unless the YAML puts them there (as `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:?…}` does). Precedence, highest first: your shell's environment, then the file given with `--env-file`, or, only when there is no `--env-file`, `.env`. `${VAR:?message}` stops Compose with that message when the variable is unset or empty (Example 5).
- **`env_file:` on a service** is read and its variables are injected **into that container**. `environment:` entries win over `env_file` entries with the same name. The long form `- path: ./app.env` with `required: false` (Compose v2.24.0+) skips a missing file instead of failing.

`docker compose config` prints the result of both, so it is the quickest way to see what a container will get. Note that it prints secrets in clear text.

**Dev vs prod override files and merging.** The base `compose.yaml` holds what every environment shares. `compose.override.yaml` is loaded automatically, so it is the natural place for development settings: a bind mount of `src/`, `node --watch`, database ports on localhost. Production uses `-f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml`, which skips the automatic override. The merge rules (Compose specification, "Merge and override"):

- **Mappings** (`environment`, `healthcheck`, …) are merged key by key; the later file wins on conflicts.
- **Sequences** are appended.
- **`command`, `entrypoint` and `healthcheck.test`** are replaced, not appended.
- **`ports`, `volumes`, `secrets`, `configs`** are appended unless an entry has the same unique key (for `volumes`, the target path; for `ports`, the host IP, target, published port and protocol together). `"80:3000"` and `"3000:3000"` differ in the published port, so a plain override publishes **both** (Example 4, edge case).
- **`!reset`** clears an attribute (`build: !reset null` makes production use only `image:`), and **`!override`** replaces it entirely instead of merging (`ports: !override [...]`).

**Running migrations on startup safely.** The app needs the schema before its first query, so "run migrations when the app boots" is tempting. Two problems:

1. **Every replica runs them.** With `docker compose up --scale app=3`, or three pods in lesson 109, three processes run the same migration at the same moment. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is not safe under concurrency: in this lesson's runs, two of three unlocked runners failed with `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pg_type_typname_nsp_index"` or `relation "orders" already exists` (Example 7). A crashing replica restarts and tries again, and a slow migration delays every replica's readiness.
2. **Failure is mixed with serving.** If the migration fails, the app is half-started: it may serve traffic against the old schema, or crash-loop.

A **one-shot `migrate` service** fixes both. It uses the same image as the app (so it has the same migration files), runs `node dist/migrate.js`, and exits. The app depends on it with `service_completed_successfully`, so the app starts only after the schema is current, and a failed migration stops the rollout before any new code serves traffic. The migration script still takes a PostgreSQL advisory lock (`pg_advisory_lock(108)`), so that a second runner started by mistake, for example two deploys at once, waits instead of racing. The same lock is used by node-pg-migrate in lesson 105. Lesson 105 also covers how to write migrations that are safe while the old app version is still running.

## Code examples

The app is the orders API from lesson 107 (`src/app.js`, its tests, and lesson 65's Dockerfile). This lesson adds the process entry point, the migration runner and the Compose files.

**Example 1 — `src/server.js`: wiring the real clients.**

javascript

```
// src/server.js — wires real clients from the environment and starts listening
import pg from 'pg';
import { Redis } from 'ioredis';
import { createApp } from './app.js';

const { DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, PORT = '3000' } = process.env;
if (!DATABASE_URL || !REDIS_URL) {
  console.error('DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL are required');
  process.exit(1);
}

const db = new pg.Pool({ connectionString: DATABASE_URL, connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000 });
// enableOfflineQueue: false makes PING fail at once while Redis is unreachable,
// instead of waiting in ioredis's queue until it reconnects
const cache = new Redis(REDIS_URL, { enableOfflineQueue: false, maxRetriesPerRequest: 1 });
cache.on('error', () => {}); // ioredis keeps reconnecting; /readyz reports the state

const server = createApp({ db, cache }).listen(Number(PORT), () => {
  console.log(`listening on :${server.address().port}`);
});

process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  server.close(async () => {
    await db.end();
    cache.disconnect();
    process.exit(0);
  });
});
```

The app does not exit when Postgres or Redis are down at boot. `pg.Pool` connects lazily on the first query, and ioredis reconnects in the background, so `/readyz` reports 503 until both answer (Example 7, part 1). The SIGTERM handler is the minimal version; lesson 66 has the full graceful shutdown. Without `enableOfflineQueue: false`, ioredis would queue the `PING` until it reconnects, and `/readyz` would hang instead of answering 503.

**Example 2 — `src/migrate.js`: a one-shot runner that exits 0 when the schema is current.**

javascript

```
// src/migrate.js — one-shot migration runner: applies pending migrations, then exits.
// Exit code 0 = schema is current; any error = non-zero exit (unhandled rejection).
import pg from 'pg';

const migrations = [
  ['001_orders', `CREATE TABLE orders (
     id serial PRIMARY KEY,
     item text NOT NULL,
     qty integer NOT NULL CHECK (qty > 0))`],
];

const client = new pg.Client({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
await client.connect();
try {
  // if a second runner starts by mistake, it waits here instead of racing
  await client.query('SELECT pg_advisory_lock(108)');
  await client.query(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations (
    name text PRIMARY KEY, run_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now())`);
  for (const [name, sql] of migrations) {
    const done = await client.query('SELECT 1 FROM schema_migrations WHERE name = $1', [name]);
    if (done.rowCount) {
      console.log(`skip ${name} (already applied)`);
      continue;
    }
    await client.query('BEGIN');
    await client.query(sql);
    await client.query('INSERT INTO schema_migrations (name) VALUES ($1)', [name]);
    await client.query('COMMIT');
    console.log(`applied ${name}`);
  }
} finally {
  // ending the session also releases the advisory lock
  await client.end();
}
```

This hand-written runner keeps the example free of extra packages. In a real project, the `migrate` service would run your migration tool instead (for example `npx node-pg-migrate up` from lesson 105). The Compose side stays the same: a command that exits 0 when the schema is current.

**Example 3 — the base file and the dev override, validated with `docker-compose config`.**

      interval: 10s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 15s
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks: [backend]

volumes:
  pgdata:

networks:
  backend:
```

yaml

```
# compose.override.yaml — development only; `docker compose up` loads it automatically
services:
  app:
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: development
    # restart on file changes; src/ is bind-mounted over the image's copy
    command: ["node", "--watch", "src/server.js"]
    volumes:

    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"
  cache:
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:6379:6379"
```

The two env files. `.env` is for Compose's interpolation; `app.env` is injected into the app container:

bash

```
# .env — read by Compose for ${...} interpolation in the compose files
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpass
APP_PORT=3000
```

bash

```
# app.env — injected into the app container as environment variables
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

The standalone Compose binary (v5.6.0, from github.com/docker/compose releases, sha256 checked against `docker-compose-linux-x86_64.sha256`) runs as `docker-compose`. `config` loads, interpolates, merges and validates the files, then prints the final model. No Docker daemon is needed for that:

What the merged output shows:

- **The override was merged in.** `app.command` was replaced by `node --watch src/server.js`, `NODE_ENV: development` was added to the `environment` mapping, the `src/` bind mount was added, and `db` and `cache` gained ports on `127.0.0.1` only.
- **Interpolation happened.** `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:?…}` and `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}` became `devpass` (from `.env`), and `${APP_PORT:-3000}` became `"3000"`.
- **`env_file` was folded in.** `LOG_LEVEL: debug` from `app.env` appears in the app's `environment`, which is what the container would receive.
- **Short forms were expanded.** Each `depends_on` entry got `required: true`, ports became the long form (`target`, `published`, `host_ip`), and `build:` became an absolute `context` plus `dockerfile: Dockerfile`.
- **Names got the project prefix:** `orders_backend`, `orders_pgdata`. The healthcheck string is wrapped only by the YAML printer.

`config` also validates against the Compose schema. A typo in a condition (`service_completed` instead of `service_completed_successfully`) is caught before anything starts:

bash

```
$ docker-compose config --quiet
validating /…/typo/compose.yaml: services.app.depends_on.migrate.condition value must be one of 'service_started', 'service_healthy', 'service_completed_successfully'
$ echo $?
1
```

> ⚠️ Unverified: the files were validated with `docker-compose config`, not run. Whether the images build and start, the health checks pass, and the order holds at run time were not tested with Docker (Examples 6 and 7 test the same order without Docker).

**Example 4 — the production override with `-f`, and edge case: `ports` are appended, not replaced.**

```

What `-f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml` produced:

- **No automatic override.** With `-f`, `compose.override.yaml` was not read: no `--watch` command (so the image's `CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]` applies), no bind mount, no database ports.
- **`build: !reset null`** removed `build:` from `app` and `migrate`, so both run the image CI pushed (`ghcr.io/example/orders-api:sha-860c190`, the `type=sha` tag from lesson 107). Both use the same image, so the migration files always match the app version.
- **`${APP_TAG:?…}`** stopped `config` with the message from the file (exit code 1) until `APP_TAG` was set.
- **`.env` was still read.** `devpass` from the development `.env` reached the production model, because Compose reads `.env` from the project directory (here the directory of the first `-f` file) whatever override files you pass. On a server, set the real value in the shell environment of the deploy (it wins over `.env`, Example 5) or pass `--env-file prod.env`, and do not ship the development `.env`.

**Edge case: `ports` are appended, not replaced.** `compose.prod-append.yaml` is the same file with `ports:` instead of `ports: !override`. The first JSON line above shows the result: the app publishes **both** `3000` (from the base file) and `80`. The two entries differ in their published port, so they have different unique keys, and the merge appends. `!override` gives only `80`. The same applies to `volumes` (unique key: the target path) and to every other sequence.

**Example 5 — `.env` interpolation: a missing variable, and the shell winning over `.env`.**

bash

```
$ : > empty.env
$ docker-compose --env-file empty.env config --quiet
time="2026-10-12T23:24:32+05:30" level=warning msg="The \"POSTGRES_PASSWORD\" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string."
time="2026-10-12T23:24:32+05:30" level=warning msg="The \"POSTGRES_PASSWORD\" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string."
error while interpolating services.db.environment.POSTGRES_PASSWORD: required variable POSTGRES_PASSWORD is missing a value: set POSTGRES_PASSWORD in .env
$ echo $?
1
$ docker-compose config --quiet; echo $?
0
$ POSTGRES_PASSWORD=from-shell docker-compose config | grep -E "POSTGRES_PASSWORD|DATABASE_URL"
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:from-shell@db:5432/app
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: from-shell
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:from-shell@db:5432/app
$ docker-compose config --environment | grep -E "^(POSTGRES_PASSWORD|APP_PORT|LOG_LEVEL)="
APP_PORT=3000
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpass
```

- **A required variable is checked once per place it is used.** `--env-file empty.env` replaces `.env`, so `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is unset. The two plain `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}` uses (in `migrate` and `app`) only printed warnings and would have become empty strings. The one `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:?…}` (in `db`) stopped Compose with the file's message. Use `:?` on every use of a required variable, or the app gets `postgres://postgres:@db…`.
- **The shell wins over `.env`.** `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=from-shell` replaced `devpass` in all three places.
- **`--environment` shows only the interpolation inputs.** `APP_PORT` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` come from `.env`. `LOG_LEVEL` is not listed, because `app.env` is an `env_file:`: it goes into the container (Example 3's output) and is never used for `${…}`.

**Example 6 — proving the startup order without Docker.** The same app and migration run against a local PostgreSQL 18.4 (the embedded-postgres package) and Redis 8.0.5, in the order Compose would use. Postgres listens on port 7010, Redis on 7020 and the app on 7030. The image's `pg_isready` is not available outside the image, so a 10-line Node probe stands in for it. The Redis check is the same `redis-cli ping`, and the app check is the exact `node -e "fetch(…/readyz)…"` command from `compose.yaml`, with the port changed.

Three runs: a fresh data directory, a second start on the same data, and a migration that fails because the app's password is wrong:

[  789 ms] migrate exited with code 1
[  794 ms] app not started: migrate did not complete successfully
[  830 ms] stopped everything
```

What this shows:

- The order is db + cache healthy → migrate exits → app starts → app healthy. The app's first health check failed (it was still starting), and the second passed.
- On the second start, the migration is a no-op (`skip 001_orders (already applied)`), so running `migrate` on every `docker compose up` is safe.
- When `migrate` exits with code 1, the app is never started. That is what `service_completed_successfully` gives you: a failed migration stops the rollout instead of starting code against the wrong schema.

**Example 7 — edge case: what goes wrong without the ordering, and with migrations in every replica.**

bash

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# no-order.sh — what goes wrong without the ordering:
#   part 1: the app starts before its dependencies and before the migration
#   part 2: three replicas each run the migration at boot
R=$HOME/.cache/nodekit-repair-tools/root/usr
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$R/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:7010/app
export REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:7020 PORT=7030

# three copies of a migration script at once, like three replicas booting
migrate_x3() {
  local pids=() i
  for i in 1 2 3; do node "$1" > "m$i.out" 2>&1 & pids+=($!); done
  for i in 1 2 3; do
    wait "${pids[$((i - 1))]}"
    echo "replica $i exit $?: $(grep -m1 -E '^(applied|skip|error)' "m$i.out")"
  done
}

echo "--- part 1: app first, dependencies later"
node dist/server.js > app.out 2>&1 & APP_PID=$!
sleep 1
echo "only the app:      /readyz $(curl -s localhost:7030/readyz)"

node ~/.cache/nodekit-repair-tools/pg/start-pg.mjs 7010 "$PGDATA_DIR" > pg.out 2>&1 & PG_PID=$!
until node pg-probe.mjs "$DATABASE_URL"; do sleep 0.5; done
echo "db + cache up:     /readyz $(curl -s localhost:7030/readyz)"
echo "no migration yet:  GET /orders -> $(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' localhost:7030/orders)"

echo "--- part 2: three replicas migrate at boot, without the advisory lock"
sed '/pg_advisory_lock/d' dist/migrate.js > dist/migrate-nolock.js
migrate_x3 dist/migrate-nolock.js
echo "schema_migrations: $(node sql.mjs 'SELECT name FROM schema_migrations')"

echo "--- part 2b: drop both tables, three replicas again, with the lock"
node sql.mjs 'DROP TABLE orders, schema_migrations' > /dev/null
migrate_x3 dist/migrate.js
echo "schema_migrations: $(node sql.mjs 'SELECT name FROM schema_migrations')"
echo "after migration:   GET /orders -> $(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' localhost:7030/orders)"

kill -TERM $APP_PID; wait $APP_PID
$R/bin/redis-cli -p 7020 shutdown nosave > /dev/null
kill -TERM $PG_PID; wait $PG_PID
echo "--- stopped"
```

`sql.mjs` is a 7-line helper that runs one statement and prints the rows as JSON. The first of four runs:

bash

```
$ bash no-order.sh
--- part 1: app first, dependencies later
only the app:      /readyz {"ready":false,"checks":{"postgres":"down (ECONNREFUSED)","redis":"down (Stream isn't writeable and enableOfflineQueue options is false)"}}
db + cache up:     /readyz {"ready":true,"checks":{"postgres":"up","redis":"up"}}
no migration yet:  GET /orders -> 500
--- part 2: three replicas migrate at boot, without the advisory lock
replica 1 exit 1: error: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pg_type_typname_nsp_index"
replica 2 exit 1: error: relation "orders" already exists
replica 3 exit 0: applied 001_orders
schema_migrations: [{"name":"001_orders"}]
--- part 2b: drop both tables, three replicas again, with the lock
replica 1 exit 0: applied 001_orders
replica 2 exit 0: skip 001_orders (already applied)
replica 3 exit 0: skip 001_orders (already applied)
schema_migrations: [{"name":"001_orders"}]
after migration:   GET /orders -> 200
--- stopped
```

How the four runs differed in part 2 (no lock): run 1 had two failures (`duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pg_type_typname_nsp_index"` and `relation "orders" already exists`), run 2 one, run 3 two, run 4 none. The race depends on timing, so it passes sometimes, which is why it reaches production. With the advisory lock (part 2b), all twelve runner processes across the four runs exited 0, and exactly one per run printed `applied`.

- **Part 1.** The app came up without its dependencies and reported `ready: false` with the reason for each. It became ready once both services answered, without a restart. But "ready" does not mean "migrated": `GET /orders` returned 500 because the table did not exist yet. That gap is what the `migrate` dependency closes.
- **`pg_type_typname_nsp_index`.** `CREATE TABLE` also creates a row type with the table's name in the `pg_type` catalog. `IF NOT EXISTS` checks for the table first, then creates it, and two sessions can both pass the check. The second one to insert the catalog row hits the unique index.

## Common mistakes & gotchas

- **`depends_on` without a condition.** The short form means `service_started`: the app starts while Postgres is still initialising. Add a `healthcheck` and `condition: service_healthy`.
- **`pg_isready` without `-h`.** On first start the image's init server listens only on the Unix socket, so a socket check can pass before the real server accepts TCP connections.
- **Postgres 18 volume at `/var/lib/postgresql/data`.** For 18+, mount `/var/lib/postgresql`. With the old path, `PGDATA` is outside your named volume and the data goes into an anonymous volume instead.
- **`curl` in a slim-image health check.** `node:24-slim` has no curl. Use `node -e "fetch(…)"` or install curl in your Dockerfile.
- **`localhost` in connection strings.** Inside a container, `localhost` is the container itself. Use the service name (`db`, `cache`).
- **Migrations in the app's startup code.** Every replica runs them at once (Example 7) and a failure leaves the app half-started. Use a one-shot `migrate` service with `service_completed_successfully`, plus a lock in the runner.
- **Expecting `.env` to reach the container.** `.env` only feeds `${…}` in the YAML. Put the variable in `environment:` or use `env_file:`.
- **Committing `.env` with real passwords.** Commit a `.env.example`, keep `.env` in `.gitignore`, and keep it out of the image with `.dockerignore` (lesson 65's `.dockerignore` already lists it).
- **Overriding `ports` in a prod file and getting both.** Sequences are appended. Use `!override` (Example 4).
- **Pasting `docker compose config` output into a ticket.** It prints interpolated secrets in clear text.
- **`docker compose down -v` on a stack with data.** `-v` removes the named volumes, including `pgdata`.
- **Publishing the database port on all interfaces.** `"5432:5432"` listens on every host interface. Use `"127.0.0.1:5432:5432"` in development and no port at all in production.

## Best practices

- **Pin image versions** (`postgres:18.4`, `redis:8.0.5`), the same ones CI and production use.
- **Health checks on every dependency**, and `depends_on` with `service_healthy` and `service_completed_successfully`.
- **One-shot `migrate` service** from the same image as the app, idempotent, with an advisory lock. The app never migrates.
- **Keep the app tolerant anyway.** Lazy connections, retries and a `/readyz` that reports each dependency, because `depends_on` only orders the first start.
- **Base file plus overrides.** Shared settings in `compose.yaml`, development in `compose.override.yaml`, production with `-f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml` and `build: !reset null` so it runs the image CI pushed.
- **Required variables fail loudly:** `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:?…}` instead of a silent empty default.
- **Run `docker compose config` in CI** (or `docker compose config --quiet`) to catch merge and interpolation errors before a deploy.
- **`init: true`** on the Node service, so a small init process is PID 1 and forwards signals (lesson 65).

## ⭐ Interview lens

> **Q: “Your app container starts before Postgres is ready. How do you fix it in Compose?”**  
> A: Give Postgres a `healthcheck` (`pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1 -U … -d …`, over TCP), and have the app use `depends_on: db: condition: service_healthy`. The short `depends_on` only waits for the container to start. The app should still connect lazily and retry, because `depends_on` only orders `docker compose up` and does nothing when Postgres restarts later. *Trap:* `pg_isready` over the Unix socket can pass during the image's first-run init.

> **Q: “Where do you run database migrations in a containerised deployment?”**  
> A: In a one-shot job from the same image, before the new app version starts: a `migrate` service with `restart: "no"` that the app depends on with `service_completed_successfully` (in Kubernetes, a Job or an init step that runs once per rollout). Not in each replica's startup code, where N replicas run the same DDL at once and a failure leaves instances half-started. The runner should be idempotent and take a lock (an advisory lock in PostgreSQL), so two runners started by mistake do not race.

> **Q: “What is the difference between `.env` and `env_file`?”**  
> A: `.env` in the project directory is read by Compose to interpolate `${VAR}` in the YAML; the shell environment overrides it. Nothing in it reaches a container unless the YAML references it. `env_file:` on a service injects the file's variables into that container's environment, and `environment:` entries override them. `docker compose config` shows the result of both.

> **Q: “How do dev and prod differ in a Compose setup?”**  
> A: The base file holds what is shared. `compose.override.yaml`, loaded automatically, adds development settings: bind-mounted source, a watch command, database ports on localhost. Production uses `-f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml`, which skips the automatic override and switches `build:` to the registry `image:`. Mappings merge, sequences append, `command` and `healthcheck.test` replace, and `!reset` and `!override` handle the rest. *Trap:* a `ports` override is appended, so both port mappings are published.

## Cheat-card

- **Files:** `compose.yaml` + automatic `compose.override.yaml`; `-f a -f b` replaces that default; `docker compose config` prints the merged, interpolated model.
- **Order:** `depends_on` + `condition: service_started | service_healthy | service_completed_successfully`; optional `restart: true` (v2.17.0+), `required: false` (v2.20.0+).
- **Health checks:** `test: ["CMD", …]` or `["CMD-SHELL", "…"]`; `interval`, `timeout`, `retries`, `start_period`, `start_interval` (v2.20.2+); exit 0 = healthy.
- **Postgres image 18+:** volume at `/var/lib/postgresql` (`PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker`); check with `pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1`.
- **Redis:** `redis-cli ping`; data dir `/data` if you persist.
- **Interpolation:** shell > `--env-file` (replaces `.env`) > `.env`; `${V:-default}`, `${V:?error}`; `$$` for a literal `$`.
- **`env_file:`** goes into the container; `environment:` wins; `required: false` (v2.24.0+).
- **Merge:** mappings merge, sequences append, `command`/`entrypoint`/`healthcheck.test` replace, `ports`/`volumes` append unless the unique key matches; `!reset`, `!override`.
- **Migrations:** one-shot `migrate` service, same image, idempotent, advisory lock; the app depends on it with `service_completed_successfully`.
- **Versions used:** Docker Compose v5.6.0 (config only), postgres:18.4, redis:8.0.5, node:24-slim.
