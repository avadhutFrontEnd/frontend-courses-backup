# Sequelize and TypeORM

*38 min read · Updated 12 Oct 2026 · Topic 103 of 106 · added to this kit, not part of the original course*

**Source:** written for this kit — examples verified on Node v24.19.0 and Sequelize 6.37.8 (sequelize-cli 6.6.5), TypeORM 1.1.2 (TypeScript 7.0.2, reflect-metadata 0.2.2), pg 8.23.1, PostgreSQL 18.4 run locally via the embedded-postgres npm package (no Docker)

## Why it matters

Sequelize and TypeORM are the two older, widely deployed ORMs in the Node ecosystem. Many existing codebases use one of them, so you will likely maintain one even if you would pick [Prisma](101-prisma-orm.md) or [Drizzle](102-drizzle-orm.md) for new work. Both libraries do the same job: they map a JavaScript class or model to a table, turn method calls such as `findAll({ include })` or `find({ relations })` into SQL, and turn rows back into objects.

The trouble is in the defaults and in the SQL they generate:

- **Sequelize** assumes every table has `createdAt` and `updatedAt` columns unless you say otherwise. On the tables in this kit, which have neither, the first `findAll()` fails.
- **`sync({ alter: true })` and `synchronize: true`** make the live table match your model. In the runs below, that dropped the `author_id`, `title`, `body` and `created_at` columns of a seeded table (Sequelize), and it reset every post's published flag to `false` (TypeORM).
- **Lazy getters in a loop** send one query per row. The same page took 9 queries instead of 1–2 in both libraries.
- **`include` / `relations` combined with `limit`** produces SQL you might not expect: a subquery in one case, a `LIMIT` on joined rows in another, and a `missing FROM-clause entry` error in a third.

This lesson runs every one of those against a real PostgreSQL 18.4 server, using the same five tables and seed data as lessons 101, 102, 104, 105 and 106, so you can compare the generated SQL across tools.

## The concept, simply

An ORM has three parts:

1. **A mapping.** It records which class goes with which table, which property goes with which column, and how tables relate. Sequelize builds the mapping with function calls: `sequelize.define(...)`, then `Post.belongsTo(User, ...)`. TypeORM builds it with TypeScript decorators on a class: `@Entity('posts')`, `@ManyToOne(() => User)`.
2. **A query generator.** It turns `Post.findAll({ include: [...] })` or `repo.find({ relations: {...} })` into one or more SQL statements, sends them through a connection pool (the `pg` driver here), and builds objects from the rows.
3. **Schema tools.** Migrations are versioned files that change the schema step by step. A "sync" mode makes the database match the model at startup. Use migrations for real databases. Sync is for throwaway ones.

The shared schema, and how each library names it:

text

```
users ─1───N─ posts ─1───N─ comments          posts ─N───N─ tags   (through post_tags)
  │                            ▲
  └──────────1───N─────────────┘  (comments.author_id)

Sequelize                                   TypeORM
User.hasMany(Post, {foreignKey})            @OneToMany(() => Post, p => p.author)    posts
Post.belongsTo(User, {as:'author'})         @ManyToOne(() => User) @JoinColumn       author
Post.hasMany(Comment)                       @OneToMany(() => Comment, c => c.post)   comments
Post.belongsToMany(Tag,{through:'post_tags'}) @ManyToMany(() => Tag) @JoinTable({name:'post_tags'})
```

## How it works

What happens when the canonical query runs ("published posts with author name, comment count and tag names, newest first"):

1. At startup the library builds metadata. For Sequelize, that is each `define()` call plus each association call. For TypeORM, `DataSource.initialize()` reads the decorator metadata that `tsc` emitted (`design:type` and the decorator calls) for every class listed in `entities`.
2. You call `Post.findAll({ where, include, order })` or `repo.createQueryBuilder('post').innerJoin(...).getMany()`.
3. The query generator picks a JOIN for each association you asked for and adds the columns it needs to rebuild the objects: primary keys of every joined table, aliased as `"author.id"` (Sequelize) or `"author_id"` (TypeORM).
4. If the query has a `limit` and a to-many include, the generator must keep the limit counting *parents*, not joined rows. Sequelize wraps the parent query in a subquery. TypeORM's `take` runs a separate `SELECT DISTINCT id … LIMIT` first.
5. The SQL goes to the pool. With logging switched on, both libraries pass the final SQL string to your logger, which is how every query count in this lesson was taken.
6. The rows come back flat, one row per post × tag. The library groups them by primary key into nested objects: `post.author.name`, `post.tags[]`.

**Versions, and which one npm gives you.** `npm install sequelize` gives 6.37.8 (published 2026-03-07), which is the stable v6 line. Sequelize v7 is a separate package, `@sequelize/core`. On npm, its `latest` tag points at `7.0.0-alpha.48` (published 2026-02-04), and the v7 docs label themselves "unreleased documentation … alpha version". This lesson uses v6. TypeORM's `latest` is 1.1.2 (published 2026-10-08). The 1.x line started with 1.0.0 on 2026-05-19, and the 0.3 line is now tagged `legacy` (0.3.31). TypeORM 1.0 removed several 0.3 APIs that older tutorials still use: string `relations: ['author']`, `loadRelationCountAndMap`, `@RelationCount`, `createConnection`/`getRepository` globals, and `findByIds`. The examples below use the 1.x replacements (removed in v1.0, see the release notes).

**Sequelize models.** `sequelize.define(name, attributes, options)` returns a model class. Three options matter on an existing schema:

- `tableName` stops Sequelize pluralising the model name.
- `timestamps: false` stops it adding `createdAt`/`updatedAt` attributes, which it does by default.
- `field` maps a camelCase attribute to a snake_case column, for example `createdAt` → `created_at`.

Associations add accessor methods to instances (`post.getAuthor()`, `post.addTags()`) and make `include` possible. The `foreignKey` option names the real column. For `belongsToMany`, passing a string in `through: 'post_tags'` makes Sequelize build a junction model for that table.

**TypeORM entities.** Each class gets `@Entity('posts')`, and each property gets `@Column`, `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn` or a relation decorator. `@ManyToOne` + `@JoinColumn({ name: 'author_id' })` is the owning side, which holds the foreign key. `@OneToMany` is the inverse side; the docs say "@OneToMany cannot exist without @ManyToOne". `@ManyToMany` + `@JoinTable` must name the junction table and both columns, or TypeORM uses its own names. A bare `@JoinTable()` on `Post.tags` resolved to table `posts_tags_tags` with columns `postsId` and `tagsId` in 1.1.2. Decorators need `"experimentalDecorators": true` and `"emitDecoratorMetadata": true` in `tsconfig.json`. Node's built-in type stripping does not transform decorators. The Node docs say they "will result in a parser error", and Example 10 shows that error. So the TypeORM project is compiled with `tsc` and run from `dist/`. TypeScript 7.0.2 (the native compiler) accepted both flags and emitted the metadata.

**Migrations.** The two CLIs behave differently. `sequelize-cli migration:generate` writes an **empty** skeleton, and you write the `queryInterface.createTable(...)` calls yourself. Sequelize v6's CLI has no model-to-migration diff. `typeorm migration:generate` connects to the database, compares it with the entity metadata, and writes a file containing the exact SQL needed to close the gap. You must review that file, because it is a diff of whatever the database looks like right now. Each CLI records applied migrations in a table: `SequelizeMeta` (one `name` column) or `migrations` (`id`, `timestamp`, `name`). TypeORM wraps a run in one transaction by default (`-t, --transaction … Enabled by default`).

**Transactions.** Both libraries offer a managed form and an unmanaged form:

- **Managed:** `sequelize.transaction(async (t) => …)` or `dataSource.transaction(async (manager) => …)`. The library commits when the callback resolves and rolls back when it throws.
- **Unmanaged:** `const t = await sequelize.transaction()` or `dataSource.createQueryRunner()` + `startTransaction()`. You call commit or rollback yourself.

The trap is the same in both: a query only joins the transaction if you route it there. In Sequelize, pass `{ transaction: t }` on every call. In TypeORM, use the `manager` argument or `queryRunner.manager`. A query without that runs on another pooled connection, outside the transaction. Example 6 and Example 15 show it reading the old value.

**`sync({ alter: true })` and `synchronize: true`.** Both read the live table, compare it with the model, and issue `ALTER TABLE` statements until the two match. A column that is in the table but not in the model gets dropped. Sequelize's `alter` also dropped `author_id`, because that model declared no association, so the foreign key column was "unknown". TypeORM 1.1.2 has a rename heuristic (`RdbmsSchemaBuilder.renameColumns`, documented in the source as "Works if only one column per table was changed"). If exactly one column disappeared and exactly one appeared with the same type and nullability, it issues `RENAME COLUMN`. Otherwise it drops the old column and adds a new one:

text

```
entity vs table diff for "posts"            what synchronize does (Example 18)
──────────────────────────────────          ───────────────────────────────────────────────
1 column renamed, nothing else changed  →   ALTER TABLE … RENAME COLUMN "title" TO "headline"
renamed + 1 new column (counts differ)  →   DROP COLUMN "title"; ADD "headline" text NOT NULL
                                            → fails on existing rows → ROLLBACK, app won't start
renamed column has a DEFAULT + new col  →   DROP COLUMN "published"; ADD "is_published" … DEFAULT false
                                            → COMMIT: every post's flag is now false (data lost)
```

**How relations get loaded, and why N+1 happens.** A lazy accessor such as `await post.getAuthor()`, or a `findOneBy` inside a loop, is one round trip per call. For 4 posts × 2 relations that is 1 + 8 = 9 queries, and the count grows with the page size. You can fix it two ways. The first is a JOIN (`include` / `relations`), which uses one query but repeats parent columns in every joined row. The second is one batched query per relation (`separate: true` in Sequelize, `relationLoadStrategy: 'query'` in TypeORM), which uses a fixed number of queries no matter how many rows the page has.

**Why `include` + `limit` gets a subquery.** With a to-many JOIN, one post with 2 comments is 2 rows, so `LIMIT 2` on the joined result can return 1 post. Sequelize avoids that by putting the `LIMIT` in a subquery over `posts` and joining the comments outside it:

text

```
default (subQuery)                               subQuery: false
SELECT "Post".*, comments.*                      SELECT posts.*, comments.*
FROM (SELECT … FROM posts                        FROM posts LEFT JOIN comments …
      ORDER BY id LIMIT 2) AS "Post"             ORDER BY id LIMIT 2        ← limits joined rows
LEFT JOIN comments ON …                          → post 1 twice (2 comments), post 2 never seen
→ posts 1 and 2, with all their comments
```

The subquery has a cost. A `where` on `'$comments.body$'` goes *inside* the subquery, where `comments` is not joined, and PostgreSQL rejects it (Example 8).

## Code examples

Every example ran against a real PostgreSQL 18.4 server on `127.0.0.1:6500`, with `DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:6500/<db>` set in the shell. Each project started from a freshly created, empty database (`node recreate-db.cjs`), then ran its own migration and seed.

**Example 1 — versions, and the three projects.** Check what npm's `latest` tag actually points at before you install:

bash

```
$ npm view sequelize dist-tags
{
  v4: '4.44.4',
  v5: '5.22.5',
  alpha: '7.0.0-alpha.9',
  latest: '6.37.8'
}
$ npm view @sequelize/core dist-tags
{ alpha: '7.0.0-alpha.42', latest: '7.0.0-alpha.48' }
$ npm view typeorm dist-tags
{
  master: '1.0.0-nightly.20260311',
  beta: '1.0.0-beta.3',
  legacy: '0.3.31',
  latest: '1.1.2',
  dev: '1.1.2-nightly.20261012'
}
```

bash

```
$ npm install sequelize@6.37.8 pg@8.23.1 sequelize-cli@6.6.5
…
$ npm ls --depth=0
seq@1.0.0 …/seq
├── pg@8.23.1
├── sequelize-cli@6.6.5
└── sequelize@6.37.8
$ npm install typeorm@1.1.2 pg@8.23.1 reflect-metadata@0.2.2 && npm install -D typescript@7.0.2 @types/node@24
…
$ npm ls --depth=0
torm@1.0.0 …/torm
├── @types/node@24.19.2
├── pg@8.23.1
├── reflect-metadata@0.2.2
├── typeorm@1.1.2
└── typescript@7.0.2
```

Both projects are CommonJS (`"type": "commonjs"` from `npm init -y`). Two small `pg` helpers sit in each project and are reused in [lesson 104](104-knex-query-builder.md). `inspect.cjs` prints query results as tables. `recreate-db.cjs` gives each run a fresh, empty database:

javascript

```
// inspect.cjs — usage: node inspect.cjs <database-url> "<sql>" ...  (prints each result with console.table)
const { Client } = require('pg');
(async () => {
  const client = new Client({ connectionString: process.argv[2] });
  await client.connect();
  for (const sql of process.argv.slice(3)) console.table((await client.query(sql)).rows);
  await client.end();
})();
```

javascript

```
// recreate-db.cjs — drop and recreate the database named in DATABASE_URL (scratch databases only)
const { Client } = require('pg');
(async () => {
  const url = new URL(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  const name = url.pathname.slice(1);
  url.pathname = '/postgres';                       // connect to the maintenance database
  const client = new Client({ connectionString: url.href });
  await client.connect();
  await client.query(`DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS "${name}" WITH (FORCE)`);
  await client.query(`CREATE DATABASE "${name}"`);
  await client.end();
  console.log('recreated database', name);
})();
```

**Example 2 — Sequelize models and associations mapped onto the existing tables.** The `logging` callback stores every SQL string, so later examples can count queries. The transaction-id prefix (`Executing (default): ` or `Executing (<uuid>): `) is stripped from each string.

javascript

```
// models.js — Sequelize 6 models mapped onto the existing tables (no sync()).
const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');

const queries = [];  // every SQL statement Sequelize sends, for counting
const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL, {
  logging: (sql) => queries.push(sql.replace(/^Executing \([^)]*\): /, '')),
  define: { timestamps: false },   // the tables have no createdAt/updatedAt columns
});

const User = sequelize.define('User', {
  email: { type: DataTypes.TEXT, allowNull: false, unique: true },
  name: { type: DataTypes.TEXT, allowNull: false },
}, { tableName: 'users' });

const Post = sequelize.define('Post', {
  title: { type: DataTypes.TEXT, allowNull: false },
  body: { type: DataTypes.TEXT, allowNull: false },
  published: { type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN, allowNull: false, defaultValue: false },
  createdAt: { type: DataTypes.DATE, field: 'created_at' },
}, { tableName: 'posts' });

const Comment = sequelize.define('Comment', {
  body: { type: DataTypes.TEXT, allowNull: false },
  createdAt: { type: DataTypes.DATE, field: 'created_at' },
}, { tableName: 'comments' });

const Tag = sequelize.define('Tag', {
  name: { type: DataTypes.TEXT, allowNull: false, unique: true },
}, { tableName: 'tags' });

// Associations. foreignKey names the real column; `as` names the accessor.
User.hasMany(Post, { foreignKey: 'author_id', as: 'posts' });
Post.belongsTo(User, { foreignKey: 'author_id', as: 'author' });
Post.hasMany(Comment, { foreignKey: 'post_id', as: 'comments' });
Comment.belongsTo(Post, { foreignKey: 'post_id' });
User.hasMany(Comment, { foreignKey: 'author_id' });
Comment.belongsTo(User, { foreignKey: 'author_id', as: 'author' });
// through: a table name string makes Sequelize build a junction model for it.
Post.belongsToMany(Tag, { through: 'post_tags', foreignKey: 'post_id', otherKey: 'tag_id', as: 'tags' });
Tag.belongsToMany(Post, { through: 'post_tags', foreignKey: 'tag_id', otherKey: 'post_id', as: 'posts' });

module.exports = { sequelize, queries, User, Post, Comment, Tag };
```

**Example 3 — Sequelize migrations with sequelize-cli.** `init` creates `config/`, `migrations/`, `seeders/` and `models/`. The config was replaced with one that reads `DATABASE_URL` (`use_env_variable`). `migration:generate` writes only a skeleton:

bash

```
$ npx sequelize-cli init
…
$ printf '{\n  "development": { "use_env_variable": "DATABASE_URL", "dialect": "postgres" }\n}\n' > config/config.json
$ npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name create-blog-schema

Sequelize CLI [Node: 24.19.0, CLI: 6.6.5, ORM: 6.37.8]

migrations folder at "…/seq/migrations" already exists.
New migration was created at …/seq/migrations/20261012141232-create-blog-schema.js .
$ cat migrations/20261012141232-create-blog-schema.js
'use strict';

/** @type {import('sequelize-cli').Migration} */
module.exports = {
  async up (queryInterface, Sequelize) {
    /**
     * Add altering commands here.
     *
     * Example:
     * await queryInterface.createTable('users', { id: Sequelize.INTEGER });
     */
  },

  async down (queryInterface, Sequelize) {
    /**
     * Add reverting commands here.
     *
     * Example:
     * await queryInterface.dropTable('users');
     */
  }
};
$ npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name blog-seed
…
New seed was created at …/seq/seeders/20261012141243-blog-seed.js .
```

json

```
{
  "development": { "use_env_variable": "DATABASE_URL", "dialect": "postgres" }
}
```

The migration, written by hand. All five tables are created inside one transaction:

javascript

```
'use strict';

/** @type {import('sequelize-cli').Migration} */
module.exports = {
  async up(queryInterface, Sequelize) {
    const fk = (table) => ({ type: Sequelize.INTEGER, allowNull: false,
      references: { model: table, key: 'id' }, onDelete: 'CASCADE' });
    const id = { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, autoIncrement: true, primaryKey: true };
    const now = { type: Sequelize.DATE, allowNull: false, defaultValue: Sequelize.fn('now') };

    await queryInterface.sequelize.transaction(async (transaction) => {
      await queryInterface.createTable('users', {
        id,
        email: { type: Sequelize.TEXT, allowNull: false, unique: true },
        name: { type: Sequelize.TEXT, allowNull: false },
      }, { transaction });
      await queryInterface.createTable('posts', {
        id,
        author_id: fk('users'),
        title: { type: Sequelize.TEXT, allowNull: false },
        body: { type: Sequelize.TEXT, allowNull: false },
        published: { type: Sequelize.BOOLEAN, allowNull: false, defaultValue: false },
        created_at: now,
      }, { transaction });
      await queryInterface.createTable('comments', {
        id,
        post_id: fk('posts'),
        author_id: fk('users'),
        body: { type: Sequelize.TEXT, allowNull: false },
        created_at: now,
      }, { transaction });
      await queryInterface.createTable('tags', {
        id,
        name: { type: Sequelize.TEXT, allowNull: false, unique: true },
      }, { transaction });
      await queryInterface.createTable('post_tags', {
        post_id: { ...fk('posts'), primaryKey: true },
        tag_id: { ...fk('tags'), primaryKey: true },
      }, { transaction });
    });
  },

  async down(queryInterface) {
    for (const t of ['post_tags', 'tags', 'comments', 'posts', 'users']) {
      await queryInterface.dropTable(t);
    }
  },
};
```

The seeder. `bulkInsert` sends one multi-row `INSERT` per table:

javascript

```
'use strict';

/** @type {import('sequelize-cli').Migration} */
module.exports = {
  async up(queryInterface) {
    // Run against an empty, freshly migrated database, so serial ids start at 1.
    await queryInterface.bulkInsert('users', [
      { email: 'ada@example.com', name: 'Ada' },     // id 1
      { email: 'lin@example.com', name: 'Lin' },     // id 2
      { email: 'grace@example.com', name: 'Grace' }, // id 3
    ]);
    await queryInterface.bulkInsert('posts', [
      { author_id: 1, title: 'Hello SQL', body: 'First post', published: true },
      { author_id: 1, title: 'Indexes', body: 'B-trees', published: true },
      { author_id: 2, title: 'Draft', body: 'WIP', published: false },
      { author_id: 3, title: 'Streams', body: 'Backpressure', published: true },
    ]);
    await queryInterface.bulkInsert('tags', [
      { name: 'sql' }, { name: 'intro' }, { name: 'perf' }, { name: 'node' }, // ids 1-4
    ]);
    await queryInterface.bulkInsert('post_tags', [
      { post_id: 1, tag_id: 1 }, { post_id: 1, tag_id: 2 },
      { post_id: 2, tag_id: 1 }, { post_id: 2, tag_id: 3 },
      { post_id: 4, tag_id: 4 },
    ]);
    await queryInterface.bulkInsert('comments', [
      { post_id: 1, author_id: 2, body: 'Nice' },
      { post_id: 1, author_id: 3, body: '+1' },
      { post_id: 4, author_id: 1, body: 'Thanks' },
    ]);
  },

  async down(queryInterface) {
    await queryInterface.sequelize.query(
      'TRUNCATE post_tags, comments, tags, posts, users RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE');
  },
};
```

Running both, then looking at the bookkeeping table:

bash

```

```

`bulkInsert` gave all four posts the same `created_at`, because they went in one statement and `now()` is fixed for the whole transaction. Every "newest first" query in this lesson therefore orders by `created_at DESC, id DESC`.

**Example 4 — the canonical query in Sequelize, with the real logged SQL.** The comment count is a correlated subquery passed through `sequelize.literal`. A `COUNT` over a JOIN would need `GROUP BY` on every selected column, and the tag JOIN would also multiply the count.

javascript

```
// canonical.js — published posts with author name, comment count and tag names, newest first
const { sequelize, queries, Post, User, Tag } = require('./models');

(async () => {
  const posts = await Post.findAll({
    where: { published: true },
    attributes: ['id', 'title', 'createdAt',
      // a correlated subquery keeps one row per post (a JOIN + COUNT would need GROUP BY on every column)
      [sequelize.literal('(SELECT count(*)::int FROM comments c WHERE c.post_id = "Post"."id")'), 'commentCount']],
    include: [
      { model: User, as: 'author', attributes: ['name'] },
      { model: Tag, as: 'tags', attributes: ['name'], through: { attributes: [] } },
    ],
    order: [['createdAt', 'DESC'], ['id', 'DESC'], [{ model: Tag, as: 'tags' }, 'name', 'ASC']],
  });
  for (const p of posts) {
    console.log(p.id, p.title, '|', p.author.name, '| comments:', p.get('commentCount'),
      '| tags:', p.tags.map((t) => t.name).join(',') || '-');
  }
  console.log('queries:', queries.length);
  console.log(queries[0]);

**Example 5 — N+1 with lazy getters, counted, then fixed.**

javascript

```
// nplus1.js — lazy association getters in a loop, then the eager-loading fix
const { sequelize, queries, Post, User, Comment } = require('./models');

(async () => {
  // N+1: one query for the posts, then two more per post
  const posts = await Post.findAll({ order: [['id', 'ASC']] });
  for (const post of posts) {
    const author = await post.getAuthor();     // SELECT … FROM users WHERE id = …
    const comments = await post.getComments(); // SELECT … FROM comments WHERE post_id = …
    console.log(post.title, '-', author.name, '-', comments.length, 'comments');
  }
  console.log('lazy getters:', queries.length, 'queries');
  queries.slice(0, 3).forEach((q) => console.log('  ' + q));
  queries.length = 0;

  // Fix A: one JOINed query
  const joined = await Post.findAll({
    include: [{ model: User, as: 'author' }, { model: Comment, as: 'comments' }],
    order: [['id', 'ASC']],
  });
  console.log('include (JOIN):', queries.length, 'query,', joined.length, 'posts');
  queries.length = 0;

  // Fix B: separate: true runs one extra query per hasMany association, not per row
  await Post.findAll({
    include: [{ model: User, as: 'author' }, { model: Comment, as: 'comments', separate: true }],
    order: [['id', 'ASC']],
  });
  console.log('include + separate:', queries.length, 'queries');
  queries.forEach((q) => console.log('  ' + q));
  await sequelize.close();
})();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Sequelize 6.37.8, PostgreSQL 18.4), `node nplus1.js`:

//     SELECT "id", "body", "created_at" AS "createdAt", "post_id", "author_id" FROM "comments" AS "Comment" WHERE "Comment"."post_id" = 1;

//     SELECT "id", "body", "created_at" AS "createdAt", "post_id", "author_id" FROM "comments" AS "Comment" WHERE "Comment"."post_id" IN (1, 2, 3, 4);
```

9 queries became 1 query with a JOIN, or 2 with `separate: true`. The counts are from the `logging` callback, not estimates.

**Example 6 — Sequelize transactions: managed with rollback, unmanaged, and the sequence that is not rolled back.**

javascript

```
// transactions.js — managed (callback) and unmanaged (manual commit/rollback) transactions
const { sequelize, queries, Post, Tag } = require('./models');

const countPosts = () => Post.count();

(async () => {
  console.log('posts before:', await countPosts());

  // 1. Managed: Sequelize commits when the callback resolves, rolls back when it throws.
  try {
    await sequelize.transaction(async (t) => {
      const post = await Post.create(
        { author_id: 2, title: 'ORMs', body: 'Tx demo', published: true }, { transaction: t });
      const tags = await Tag.findAll({ where: { name: ['sql', 'node'] }, transaction: t });
      await post.addTags(tags, { transaction: t });  // INSERT INTO post_tags …
      console.log('inside tx, post id', post.id, 'posts:', await Post.count({ transaction: t }));
      throw new Error('payment failed');              // → ROLLBACK
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('managed tx rolled back:', err.message);
  }
  console.log('posts after managed rollback:', await countPosts());
  console.log(queries.filter((q) => /START|COMMIT|ROLLBACK|INSERT/.test(q)).join('\n'));
  queries.length = 0;

  // 2. Unmanaged: you call commit() or rollback() yourself, exactly once.
  const t = await sequelize.transaction();
  try {
    await Post.update({ published: false }, { where: { id: 1 }, transaction: t });
    console.log('inside tx  post 1 published =',
      (await Post.findByPk(1, { transaction: t })).published);
    console.log('outside tx post 1 published =',
      (await Post.findByPk(1)).published);         // no `transaction` → another connection
    await t.rollback();                            // decided not to keep it
  } catch (err) {
    await t.rollback();
    throw err;
  }
  console.log('after rollback post 1 published =', (await Post.findByPk(1)).published);

  // 3. A sequence is not transactional: the rolled-back INSERT still used up an id.
  const [[{ last_value }]] = await sequelize.query('SELECT last_value FROM posts_id_seq');
  console.log('posts_id_seq last_value:', last_value);
  await sequelize.close();
})();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Sequelize 6.37.8, PostgreSQL 18.4), `node transactions.js`:
//   posts before: 4
//   inside tx, post id 5 posts: 5
//   managed tx rolled back: payment failed
//   posts after managed rollback: 4
//   START TRANSACTION;
//   INSERT INTO "posts" ("id","title","body","published","author_id") VALUES (DEFAULT,$1,$2,$3,$4) RETURNING "id","title","body","published","created_at","author_id";
//   INSERT INTO "post_tags" ("post_id","tag_id") VALUES (5,1),(5,4) RETURNING "post_id","tag_id";
//   ROLLBACK;
//   inside tx  post 1 published = false
//   outside tx post 1 published = true
//   after rollback post 1 published = true
//   posts_id_seq last_value: 5
```

`post.addTags` wrote the junction rows inside the same transaction, and the `ROLLBACK` removed them too. The read without `{ transaction: t }` ran on a different pooled connection and saw the committed value. `posts_id_seq` reads 5 after the rollback, because the rolled-back `INSERT` still used up id 5. Sequences are not transactional, so ids can have gaps.

**Example 7 — pitfall: the default timestamps, and `paranoid`.** The same table mapped with and without `timestamps: false`:

javascript

```
// timestamps.js — the default model options assume createdAt/updatedAt columns
const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { logging: false });

const Tag = sequelize.define('Tag', { name: DataTypes.TEXT }, { tableName: 'tags' });
const FixedTag = sequelize.define('FixedTag', { name: DataTypes.TEXT },
  { tableName: 'tags', timestamps: false });

(async () => {
  console.log('attributes Sequelize added:', Object.keys(Tag.getAttributes()));
  try {
    await Tag.findAll();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err.name, '-', err.message);
    console.log('SQL:', err.sql);
  }
  try {
    await Tag.create({ name: 'graphql' });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err.name, '-', err.message);
  }
  const rows = await FixedTag.findAll({ order: [['id', 'ASC']], raw: true });
  console.log('with timestamps: false ->', rows.map((r) => r.name));
  await sequelize.close();
})();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Sequelize 6.37.8, PostgreSQL 18.4), `node timestamps.js`:
//   attributes Sequelize added: [ 'id', 'name', 'createdAt', 'updatedAt' ]
//   SequelizeDatabaseError - column "createdAt" does not exist
//   SQL: SELECT "id", "name", "createdAt", "updatedAt" FROM "tags" AS "Tag";
//   SequelizeDatabaseError - column "createdAt" of relation "tags" does not exist
//   with timestamps: false -> [ 'sql', 'intro', 'perf', 'node' ]
```

`paranoid: true` turns `destroy()` into an `UPDATE` of a `deletedAt` column. The Sequelize docs say "Paranoid requires timestamps to work", and the first model below shows what happens without them. `paranoid` stays `true` on the options, but `destroy()` issues a real `DELETE`, with no warning:

javascript

```
// paranoid.js — paranoid: true turns destroy() into an UPDATE of deletedAt
const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const log = [];
const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { logging: (s) => log.push(s) });

// paranoid needs timestamps; with timestamps: false it is silently ignored
const NoTs = sequelize.define('NoTs', { name: DataTypes.TEXT },
  { tableName: 'tags', timestamps: false, paranoid: true });
const Soft = sequelize.define('Soft', { name: DataTypes.TEXT },
  { tableName: 'tags', paranoid: true, createdAt: false, updatedAt: false, deletedAt: 'deleted_at' });

(async () => {
  console.log('NoTs paranoid?', NoTs.options.paranoid, NoTs.getAttributes().deleted_at ? 'has deleted_at' : 'no deleted_at attr');
  await sequelize.transaction(async (transaction) => {
    await NoTs.destroy({ where: { name: 'node' }, transaction });
    console.log(log.at(-1));
    throw new Error('rollback on purpose');
  }).catch((e) => console.log(e.message));
  try {
    await Soft.destroy({ where: { name: 'node' } });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err.name, '-', err.message);
    console.log(log.at(-1));
  }
  await sequelize.close();
})();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Sequelize 6.37.8, PostgreSQL 18.4), `node paranoid.js`:
//   NoTs paranoid? true no deleted_at attr
//   Executing (1194fe72-6c97-4bc4-93ee-10835543f7fe): DELETE FROM "tags" WHERE "name" = 'node'
//   rollback on purpose
//   SequelizeDatabaseError - column "deleted_at" does not exist
//   Executing (default): UPDATE "tags" SET "deleted_at"=$1 WHERE "deleted_at" IS NULL AND "name" = $2
```

The first `DELETE` ran inside a transaction that was then rolled back on purpose, so the seed is intact. The fix is the same for both: declare exactly the columns the table has. That means `timestamps: false` here. A soft-delete model needs a real `deleted_at` column, added by a migration.

**Example 8 — pitfall: `include` of a hasMany with `limit`.**

javascript

```
// include-limit.js — include of a hasMany + limit: Sequelize wraps the parent in a subquery
const { sequelize, queries, Post, Comment } = require('./models');

const show = (label, posts) => console.log(label, posts.map((p) => `${p.id}:${p.comments.length}c`).join(' '));

(async () => {
  const opts = { include: [{ model: Comment, as: 'comments' }], order: [['id', 'ASC']], limit: 2 };

  show('default      ->', await Post.findAll(opts));
  console.log(queries.at(-1));

  // subQuery: false puts LIMIT on the joined rows, not on posts
  show('subQuery:false ->', await Post.findAll({ ...opts, subQuery: false }));
  console.log(queries.at(-1));

  // a required include + limit: the WHERE EXISTS-style filter moves inside the subquery
  show('required:true ->', await Post.findAll({ ...opts, include: [{ model: Comment, as: 'comments', required: true }] }));
  console.log(queries.at(-1));

  // a '$nested.column$' filter + limit: the WHERE lands inside the subquery, where "comments" is not joined
  try {
    await Post.findAll({ ...opts, where: { '$comments.body$': 'Nice' } });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err.name, '-', err.message);
    console.log(queries.at(-1));
  }
  await sequelize.close();
})();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Sequelize 6.37.8, PostgreSQL 18.4), `node include-limit.js`:
//   default      -> 1:2c 2:0c
//   SELECT "Post".*, "comments"."id" AS "comments.id", "comments"."body" AS "comments.body", "comments"."created_at" AS "comments.createdAt", "comments"."post_id" AS "comments.post_id", "comments"."author_id" AS "comments.author_id" FROM (SELECT "Post"."id", "Post"."title", "Post"."body", "Post"."published", "Post"."created_at" AS "createdAt", "Post"."author_id" FROM "posts" AS "Post" ORDER BY "Post"."id" ASC LIMIT 2) AS "Post" LEFT OUTER JOIN "comments" AS "comments" ON "Post"."id" = "comments"."post_id" ORDER BY "Post"."id" ASC;
//   subQuery:false -> 1:2c
//   SELECT "Post"."id", "Post"."title", "Post"."body", "Post"."published", "Post"."created_at" AS "createdAt", "Post"."author_id", "comments"."id" AS "comments.id", "comments"."body" AS "comments.body", "comments"."created_at" AS "comments.createdAt", "comments"."post_id" AS "comments.post_id", "comments"."author_id" AS "comments.author_id" FROM "posts" AS "Post" LEFT OUTER JOIN "comments" AS "comments" ON "Post"."id" = "comments"."post_id" ORDER BY "Post"."id" ASC LIMIT 2;
//   required:true -> 1:2c 4:1c
//   SELECT "Post".*, "comments"."id" AS "comments.id", "comments"."body" AS "comments.body", "comments"."created_at" AS "comments.createdAt", "comments"."post_id" AS "comments.post_id", "comments"."author_id" AS "comments.author_id" FROM (SELECT "Post"."id", "Post"."title", "Post"."body", "Post"."published", "Post"."created_at" AS "createdAt", "Post"."author_id" FROM "posts" AS "Post" WHERE ( SELECT "post_id" FROM "comments" AS "comments" WHERE ("comments"."post_id" = "Post"."id") LIMIT 1 ) IS NOT NULL ORDER BY "Post"."id" ASC LIMIT 2) AS "Post" INNER JOIN "comments" AS "comments" ON "Post"."id" = "comments"."post_id" ORDER BY "Post"."id" ASC;
//   SequelizeDatabaseError - missing FROM-clause entry for table "comments"
//   SELECT "Post".*, "comments"."id" AS "comments.id", "comments"."body" AS "comments.body", "comments"."created_at" AS "comments.createdAt", "comments"."post_id" AS "comments.post_id", "comments"."author_id" AS "comments.author_id" FROM (SELECT "Post"."id", "Post"."title", "Post"."body", "Post"."published", "Post"."created_at" AS "createdAt", "Post"."author_id" FROM "posts" AS "Post" WHERE "comments"."body" = 'Nice' ORDER BY "Post"."id" ASC LIMIT 2) AS "Post" LEFT OUTER JOIN "comments" AS "comments" ON "Post"."id" = "comments"."post_id" ORDER BY "Post"."id" ASC;
```

- The default wraps `posts … LIMIT 2` in a subquery, which gives the correct 2 posts.
- `subQuery: false` applies the limit to joined rows, so it returns 1 post.
- `required: true` adds a correlated `IS NOT NULL` check inside the subquery.
- The `$comments.body$` filter lands inside the subquery, where `comments` does not exist, and PostgreSQL rejects it.

For that last one, use `required: true` with a `where` on the include itself, or drop the limit. For pagination over parents, `separate: true` on the to-many include avoids the subquery entirely.

**Example 9 — edge case: `sync({ alter: true })` on a seeded table (scratch database).** A model where someone renamed `title` to `headline` and left out `body`. It was run against a separate, freshly migrated and seeded database, `seqalter`:

javascript

```
// alter.js — sync({ alter: true }) makes the table match the model, data or not. Scratch DB only.
const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const sql = [];
const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { logging: (s) => sql.push(s.replace(/^Executing \([^)]*\): /, '')) });

// Someone renamed `title` to `headline` in the model and removed `body`.
const Post = sequelize.define('Post', {
  headline: { type: DataTypes.TEXT },
  published: { type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN, allowNull: false, defaultValue: false },
}, { tableName: 'posts', timestamps: false });

(async () => {
  const [before] = await sequelize.query('SELECT id, title, body FROM posts ORDER BY id');
  console.log('before:', before);
  await Post.sync({ alter: true });
  sql.filter((s) => /^ALTER/.test(s)).forEach((s) => console.log(s));
  const [after] = await sequelize.query('SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY id');
  console.log('after:', after);
  await sequelize.close();
})();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, Sequelize 6.37.8, PostgreSQL 18.4), `node alter.js`:
//   before: [
//     { id: 1, title: 'Hello SQL', body: 'First post' },
//     { id: 2, title: 'Indexes', body: 'B-trees' },
//     { id: 3, title: 'Draft', body: 'WIP' },
//     { id: 4, title: 'Streams', body: 'Backpressure' }
//   ]
//   ALTER TABLE "public"."posts" ADD COLUMN "headline" TEXT;
//   ALTER TABLE "public"."posts" DROP COLUMN "author_id";
//   ALTER TABLE "public"."posts" DROP COLUMN "title";
//   ALTER TABLE "public"."posts" DROP COLUMN "body";
//   ALTER TABLE "posts" ALTER COLUMN "published" SET NOT NULL;ALTER TABLE "posts" ALTER COLUMN "published" SET DEFAULT false;ALTER TABLE "posts" ALTER COLUMN "published" TYPE BOOLEAN;
//   ALTER TABLE "public"."posts" DROP COLUMN "created_at";
//   after: [
//     { id: 1, published: true, headline: null },
//     { id: 2, published: true, headline: null },
//     { id: 3, published: false, headline: null },
//     { id: 4, published: true, headline: null }
//   ]
```

Sequelize has no rename detection. It added an empty `headline` and dropped `title`, `body` and `created_at`. It also dropped `author_id`, because this model declared no `belongsTo`, so the foreign key column was not part of the model. Dropping `author_id` also dropped its foreign key. The Sequelize docs say `sync({ force: true })` and `sync({ alter: true })` "can be destructive operations. Therefore, they are not recommended for production-level software."

**Example 10 — TypeORM project setup: tsconfig, entities, DataSource, build.** Node's built-in type stripping cannot run decorators:

typescript

```
// decorators.mts — does Node's built-in type stripping accept a decorator?
const Entity = (table: string) => (target: Function) => target;

@Entity('users')
class User { id!: number; }

console.log(User.name);
```

bash

```
$ node decorators.mts
file://…/torm/decorators.mts:4
@Entity('users')
^

SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
```

So the project is compiled with `tsc`:

The DataSource is used by both the app and the CLI. Its custom logger collects every query for counting. It also prints the CLI's schema and migration messages, and prints SQL when `LOG_SQL` is set.

  logQuery: (sql, params) => {
    queries.push(params?.length ? `${sql} -- ${JSON.stringify(params)}` : sql);
    if (process.env.LOG_SQL) console.log('query: ' + sql);
  },
  logQueryError: (err, sql) => console.log('query failed:', String(err), '\n  ', sql),
  logQuerySlow: () => {},
  logSchemaBuild: (message) => console.log(message),  // the migration CLI reports progress here
  logMigration: (message) => console.log(message),
  log: (level, message) => { if (level === 'warn') console.log(message); },
};

export const AppDataSource = new DataSource({
  type: 'postgres',
  url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  entities: [User, Post, Comment, Tag],
  migrations: [__dirname + '/migrations/*.js'],
  synchronize: false,          // schema changes go through migrations

It matches the shared schema, plus two things TypeORM adds by default: an index on each `post_tags` column, and `ON UPDATE CASCADE` on the junction foreign keys. Constraint names are hashes such as `PK_a3ffb1c0c8416b9fc6f907b7433`, so they are stable for the same table and columns. After `npx tsc -p .`, run it on a fresh database:

`--check` is the CI guard. It exits 0 when the entities and the database agree, and 1 when a migration is missing.

**Example 12 — seeding through the ORM.** Saving a `Post` with `tags` set also writes its `post_tags` rows.

typescript

```
// src/seed.ts — the shared seed, written through the ORM
import { AppDataSource } from './data-source.js';
import { User, Post, Comment, Tag } from './entities.js';

async function main() {
  await AppDataSource.initialize();
  await AppDataSource.transaction(async (m) => {
    const [ada, lin, grace] = await m.save(User, [
      { email: 'ada@example.com', name: 'Ada' },
      { email: 'lin@example.com', name: 'Lin' },
      { email: 'grace@example.com', name: 'Grace' },
    ]);
    const [sql, intro, perf, node] = await m.save(Tag,
      ['sql', 'intro', 'perf', 'node'].map((name) => ({ name })));
    // saving a post with `tags` set also writes its post_tags rows
    const [p1, , , p4] = await m.save(Post, [
      { author: ada, title: 'Hello SQL', body: 'First post', published: true, tags: [sql, intro] },
      { author: ada, title: 'Indexes', body: 'B-trees', published: true, tags: [sql, perf] },
      { author: lin, title: 'Draft', body: 'WIP', published: false, tags: [] },
      { author: grace, title: 'Streams', body: 'Backpressure', published: true, tags: [node] },
    ]);
    await m.save(Comment, [
      { post: p1, author: lin, body: 'Nice' },
      { post: p1, author: grace, body: '+1' },
      { post: p4, author: ada, body: 'Thanks' },
    ]);
  });
  const counts = await AppDataSource.query(
    `SELECT (SELECT count(*) FROM users) AS users, (SELECT count(*) FROM posts) AS posts,
            (SELECT count(*) FROM comments) AS comments, (SELECT count(*) FROM post_tags) AS post_tags`);
  console.log(counts[0]);
  await AppDataSource.destroy();
}
main();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, TypeORM 1.1.2, TypeScript 7.0.2, PostgreSQL 18.4), `node dist/seed.js`:

```

**Example 13 — the canonical query in TypeORM, with the real logged SQL.** `commentCount` comes from the `@VirtualColumn` sub-query on the entity (added in v1.0 as the replacement for `loadRelationCountAndMap`).

typescript

```
// src/canonical.ts — published posts with author name, comment count and tag names, newest first
import { AppDataSource, queries } from './data-source.js';
import { Post } from './entities.js';

async function main() {
  await AppDataSource.initialize();
  queries.length = 0;
  const posts = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Post)
    .createQueryBuilder('post')
    .innerJoin('post.author', 'author').addSelect('author.name')
    .leftJoin('post.tags', 'tag').addSelect('tag.name')
    .where('post.published = :published', { published: true })
    .orderBy('post.createdAt', 'DESC').addOrderBy('post.id', 'DESC').addOrderBy('tag.name', 'ASC')
    .getMany();   // commentCount comes from the @VirtualColumn sub-query

  for (const p of posts) {
    console.log(p.id, p.title, '|', p.author.name, '| comments:', p.commentCount,
      '| tags:', p.tags.map((t) => t.name).join(',') || '-');
  }
  console.log('queries:', queries.length);
  console.log(queries[0]);
  await AppDataSource.destroy();
}
main();

```

**Example 14 — N+1 in TypeORM, counted, then fixed two ways.**

typescript

```
// src/nplus1.ts — per-post lookups in a loop, then the relations fix
import { AppDataSource, queries } from './data-source.js';
import { Post, User, Comment } from './entities.js';

async function main() {
  await AppDataSource.initialize();
  const m = AppDataSource.manager;
  queries.length = 0;

  // N+1: one query for the posts, then two per post
  const posts = await m.find(Post, { order: { id: 'ASC' } });
  for (const post of posts) {
    const author = await m.findOneByOrFail(User, { id: post.authorId });
    const comments = await m.findBy(Comment, { post: { id: post.id } });
    console.log(post.title, '-', author.name, '-', comments.length, 'comments');
  }
  console.log('loop:', queries.length, 'queries');
  queries.slice(1, 3).forEach((q) => console.log('  ' + q));

  // Fix A: relations → one query with LEFT/INNER JOINs
  queries.length = 0;
  await m.find(Post, { relations: { author: true, comments: true }, order: { id: 'ASC' } });
  console.log('relations (join):', queries.length, 'query');

  // Fix B: relationLoadStrategy 'query' → one query per relation, not per row
  queries.length = 0;
  await m.find(Post, { relations: { author: true, comments: true }, relationLoadStrategy: 'query',
    order: { id: 'ASC' } });
  console.log("relationLoadStrategy 'query':", queries.length, 'queries');
  queries.forEach((q) => console.log('  ' + q));
  await AppDataSource.destroy();
}
main();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, TypeORM 1.1.2, TypeScript 7.0.2, PostgreSQL 18.4), `node dist/nplus1.js`:

//   relations (join): 1 query
//   relationLoadStrategy 'query': 4 queries
//     SELECT "Post"."id" AS "Post_id", "Post"."author_id" AS "Post_author_id", "Post"."title" AS "Post_title", "Post"."body" AS "Post_body", "Post"."published" AS "Post_published", "Post"."created_at" AS "Post_created_at", (SELECT count(*) FROM comments c WHERE c.post_id = "Post".id) AS "Post_commentCount" FROM "posts" "Post" ORDER BY "Post"."id" ASC
//     SELECT "User"."id" AS "User_id", "User"."email" AS "User_email", "User"."name" AS "User_name" FROM "users" "User" INNER JOIN "posts" "Post" ON "Post"."author_id" = "User"."id" WHERE "Post"."id" IN ($1, $2, $3, $4) -- [1,2,3,4]
//     SELECT "Comment"."id" AS "Comment_id", "Comment"."body" AS "Comment_body", "Comment"."created_at" AS "Comment_created_at", "Comment"."post_id" AS "Comment_post_id", "Comment"."author_id" AS "Comment_author_id" FROM "comments" "Comment" WHERE "Comment"."post_id" IN ($1, $2, $3, $4) -- [1,2,3,4]
//     SELECT "Comment"."id" AS "Comment_comments_id", "Comment"."post_id" AS "Post_id" FROM "comments" "Comment" WHERE "Comment"."post_id" IN (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

The loop made 9 queries. `relations` brought that down to 1 JOINed query. `relationLoadStrategy: 'query'` used 4: the posts, the authors by `IN`, the comments by `IN`, and a fourth query TypeORM uses to map comment ids back to posts. Notice the `@VirtualColumn` sub-query in the posts `SELECT`. A virtual column is computed on **every** query of that entity, whether or not you read it.

**Example 15 — TypeORM transactions: managed with rollback, unmanaged with a QueryRunner.**

typescript

```
// src/transactions.ts — managed (callback) and unmanaged (QueryRunner) transactions
import { AppDataSource, queries } from './data-source.js';
import { Post, Tag } from './entities.js';
import { In } from 'typeorm';

async function main() {
  await AppDataSource.initialize();
  const posts = AppDataSource.getRepository(Post);
  console.log('posts before:', await posts.count());

  // 1. Managed: commit when the callback resolves, ROLLBACK when it throws.
  //    Use the `manager` argument; the global repository would run outside the transaction.
  queries.length = 0;
  try {
    await AppDataSource.transaction(async (manager) => {
      const tags = await manager.findBy(Tag, { name: In(['sql', 'node']) });
      const post = await manager.save(Post,
        { authorId: 2, title: 'ORMs', body: 'Tx demo', published: true, tags });
      console.log('inside tx, post id', post.id, 'posts:', await manager.count(Post));
      throw new Error('payment failed');
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('managed tx rolled back:', (err as Error).message);
  }
  console.log('posts after managed rollback:', await posts.count());
  queries.filter((q) => /^(START|COMMIT|ROLLBACK|INSERT)/.test(q))
    .forEach((q) => console.log('  ' + q));

  // 2. Unmanaged: one QueryRunner = one pooled connection; you start, end and release it.
  const qr = AppDataSource.createQueryRunner();
  await qr.connect();
  await qr.startTransaction();
  try {
    await qr.manager.update(Post, { id: 1 }, { published: false });
    console.log('inside tx  post 1 published =', (await qr.manager.findOneByOrFail(Post, { id: 1 })).published);
    console.log('outside tx post 1 published =', (await posts.findOneByOrFail({ id: 1 })).published);
    await qr.rollbackTransaction();                  // decided not to keep it
  } catch (err) {
    await qr.rollbackTransaction();
    throw err;
  } finally {
    await qr.release();                              // always return the connection
  }
  console.log('after rollback post 1 published =', (await posts.findOneByOrFail({ id: 1 })).published);
  await AppDataSource.destroy();
}
main();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, TypeORM 1.1.2, TypeScript 7.0.2, PostgreSQL 18.4), `node dist/transactions.js`:
//   posts before: 4
//   inside tx, post id 5 posts: 5
//   managed tx rolled back: payment failed
//   posts after managed rollback: 4
//     START TRANSACTION
//     INSERT INTO "posts"("author_id", "title", "body", "published", "created_at") VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, DEFAULT) RETURNING "id", "published", "created_at" -- [2,"ORMs","Tx demo",1]
//     INSERT INTO "post_tags"("post_id", "tag_id") VALUES ($1, $2), ($3, $4) -- [5,1,5,4]
//     ROLLBACK
//   inside tx  post 1 published = false
//   outside tx post 1 published = true
//   after rollback post 1 published = true
```

The `post_tags` rows were written with the post, and both were rolled back. In the QueryRunner block, the read through `qr.manager` saw the uncommitted `false`. The read through the global repository went to another connection and saw `true`. `release()` in `finally` returns the connection to the pool, as in [lesson 46](46-connection-pooling.md).

**Example 16 — pitfall: `eager: true`.** These are separate minimal entities on the same tables, so the main entities stay lazy:

typescript

```
// src/eager.ts — eager: true loads the relation on every find(), but QueryBuilder ignores it
import 'reflect-metadata';
import { DataSource, Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, ManyToOne, JoinColumn } from 'typeorm';

@Entity('users')
class Author {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn() id: number;
  @Column({ type: 'text' }) name: string;
}

@Entity('posts')
class EagerPost {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn() id: number;
  @Column({ type: 'text' }) title: string;
  @ManyToOne(() => Author, { eager: true, nullable: false })
  @JoinColumn({ name: 'author_id' })
  author: Author;
}

const sql: string[] = [];
const ds = new DataSource({
  type: 'postgres', url: process.env.DATABASE_URL, entities: [Author, EagerPost],
  logger: { logQuery: (q) => sql.push(q), logQueryError() {}, logQuerySlow() {},
    logSchemaBuild() {}, logMigration() {}, log() {} },
});

async function main() {
  await ds.initialize();
  const repo = ds.getRepository(EagerPost);

  // only ids and titles wanted, yet the eager JOIN is added
  const titles = await repo.find({ select: { id: true, title: true }, order: { id: 'ASC' } });
  console.log('find():', titles[0], '\n  ', sql.at(-1));

  const viaQb = await repo.createQueryBuilder('p').orderBy('p.id', 'ASC').getMany();
  console.log('QueryBuilder:', viaQb[0], '\n  ', sql.at(-1));
  await ds.destroy();
}
main();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, TypeORM 1.1.2, TypeScript 7.0.2, PostgreSQL 18.4), `node dist/eager.js`:
//   find(): EagerPost {
//     id: 1,
//     title: 'Hello SQL',
//     author: Author { id: 1, name: 'Ada' }
//   }
//      SELECT "EagerPost"."id" AS "EagerPost_id", "EagerPost"."title" AS "EagerPost_title", "EagerPost__author"."id" AS "EagerPost__author_id", "EagerPost__author"."name" AS "EagerPost__author_name" FROM "posts" "EagerPost" INNER JOIN "users" "EagerPost__author" ON "EagerPost__author"."id"="EagerPost"."author_id" ORDER BY "EagerPost_id" ASC
//   QueryBuilder: EagerPost { id: 1, title: 'Hello SQL', author: undefined }
//      SELECT "p"."id" AS "p_id", "p"."title" AS "p_title", "p"."author_id" AS "p_author_id" FROM "posts" "p" ORDER BY "p"."id" ASC
```

`find()` added the JOIN even though only `id` and `title` were selected. QueryBuilder ignored `eager` entirely and returned `author: undefined`, which the TypeORM docs state: "If you use QueryBuilder eager relations are disabled". The join is `INNER` because the relation is `nullable: false` (changed in v1.0; the same file compiled against typeorm@0.3.31 produced `LEFT JOIN`).

**Example 17 — pitfall: `find` with relations and pagination, and `limit()` vs `take()`.**

typescript

```
// src/paginate.ts — find() with relations + take/skip, and limit() vs take() in QueryBuilder
import { AppDataSource, queries } from './data-source.js';
import { Post } from './entities.js';

const show = (label: string, posts: Post[]) =>
  console.log(label, posts.map((p) => `${p.id}:${p.comments.length}c`).join(' '));

async function main() {
  await AppDataSource.initialize();
  const repo = AppDataSource.getRepository(Post);

  // find + relations + take: TypeORM first selects DISTINCT ids, then loads those posts
  queries.length = 0;
  show('find take:2      ->', await repo.find({ relations: { comments: true }, order: { id: 'ASC' }, take: 2 }));
  console.log(queries.length, 'queries'); queries.forEach((q) => console.log('  ' + q));

  // QueryBuilder .limit() puts LIMIT on the joined rows
  queries.length = 0;
  show('qb limit(2)      ->', await repo.createQueryBuilder('post')
    .leftJoinAndSelect('post.comments', 'comment').orderBy('post.id', 'ASC').limit(2).getMany());
  console.log('  ' + queries[0].replace(/^SELECT .* FROM/, 'SELECT … FROM'));

  // QueryBuilder .take() paginates entities (same two-step query as find)

```

`find({ relations, take })` and QueryBuilder `.take()` both run two queries: a `SELECT DISTINCT` of the page's ids, then the data `WHERE "Post"."id" IN (1, 2)`. `.limit(2)` sends a plain `LIMIT 2` on the joined rows and returned one post. With joins, use `take`/`skip`. Use `limit`/`offset` only for queries without to-many joins.

**Example 18 — edge case: `synchronize: true` and a renamed property (scratch database).** Three entity versions of `posts`, each run against a freshly migrated and seeded copy of the database:

typescript

```
// src/sync-rename.ts — synchronize: true after renaming a property. Scratch database ONLY.
// usage: node dist/sync-rename.js rename | rename+column | rename-default+column
import 'reflect-metadata';
import { DataSource, Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, CreateDateColumn,
  ManyToOne, JoinColumn } from 'typeorm';

@Entity('users')
class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn() id: number;
  @Column({ type: 'text', unique: true }) email: string;
  @Column({ type: 'text' }) name: string;
}

// A: only `title` renamed to `headline`
@Entity('posts')
class PostA {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn() id: number;
  @ManyToOne(() => User, { nullable: false, onDelete: 'CASCADE' })
  @JoinColumn({ name: 'author_id' }) author: User;
  @Column({ type: 'text' }) headline: string;                  // was title
  @Column({ type: 'text' }) body: string;
  @Column({ default: false }) published: boolean;
  @CreateDateColumn({ name: 'created_at', type: 'timestamptz' }) createdAt: Date;
}

// B: the same rename, shipped together with a new column
@Entity('posts')
class PostB {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn() id: number;
  @ManyToOne(() => User, { nullable: false, onDelete: 'CASCADE' })
  @JoinColumn({ name: 'author_id' }) author: User;
  @Column({ type: 'text' }) headline: string;                  // was title
  @Column({ type: 'text' }) body: string;
  @Column({ default: false }) published: boolean;
  @CreateDateColumn({ name: 'created_at', type: 'timestamptz' }) createdAt: Date;
  @Column({ type: 'text', nullable: true }) summary: string | null;  // new
}

// C: a column WITH a default renamed, plus a new column
@Entity('posts')
class PostC {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn() id: number;
  @ManyToOne(() => User, { nullable: false, onDelete: 'CASCADE' })
  @JoinColumn({ name: 'author_id' }) author: User;
  @Column({ type: 'text' }) title: string;
  @Column({ type: 'text' }) body: string;
  @Column({ name: 'is_published', default: false }) isPublished: boolean; // was published
  @CreateDateColumn({ name: 'created_at', type: 'timestamptz' }) createdAt: Date;
  @Column({ type: 'text', nullable: true }) summary: string | null;  // new
}

const variants = { 'rename': PostA, 'rename+column': PostB, 'rename-default+column': PostC };

async function main() {
  const variant = process.argv[2] as keyof typeof variants;
  const ddl: string[] = [];
  const ds = new DataSource({
    type: 'postgres', url: process.env.DATABASE_URL, entities: [User, variants[variant]],
    synchronize: true,                               // diff entities → ALTER the live tables
    logger: { logQuery: (q) => { if (/^(ALTER|START|COMMIT|ROLLBACK)/.test(q)) ddl.push(q); },
      logQueryError() {}, logQuerySlow() {}, logSchemaBuild() {}, logMigration() {}, log() {} },
  });
  console.log(variant, 'before:', JSON.stringify(await rows()));
  try {
    await ds.initialize();                           // synchronize runs inside initialize()
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('initialize() threw:', (err as Error).message);
  }
  ddl.forEach((q) => console.log('  ' + q));
  console.log(variant, 'after: ', JSON.stringify(await rows()));
  if (ds.isInitialized) await ds.destroy();
}

// read the table through a plain DataSource (no entities, no sync)
async function rows() {
  const raw = new DataSource({ type: 'postgres', url: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
  await raw.initialize();
  const r = await raw.query('SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY id');
  await raw.destroy();
  return r.map(({ created_at, body, author_id, ...rest }: any) => rest);  // trim for display
}
main();
```

The driver script recreates the scratch database before each variant:

bash

```
# sync-demo.sh — run in the TypeORM project: per variant, a fresh scratch DB, migrate, seed, synchronize
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:6500/tormsync
for v in rename rename+column rename-default+column; do
  node recreate-db.cjs > /dev/null
  npx typeorm migration:run -d dist/data-source.js > /dev/null
  node dist/seed.js > /dev/null
  node dist/sync-rename.js "$v"
done
```

bash

```
$ bash sync-demo.sh

```

- **Variant A**, a lone rename, became `RENAME COLUMN` and kept the data.
- **Variant B** shipped the same rename with one new column. The column counts no longer matched, so the heuristic did not apply, and TypeORM tried `DROP COLUMN` + `ADD … NOT NULL`. PostgreSQL rejected the `ADD` on a table with rows, the transaction rolled back, and `initialize()` threw. The app would not start.
- **Variant C** renamed a column that has a `DEFAULT`. The `ADD` succeeded, the transaction committed, and every post's published flag was lost. The Draft/published distinction is gone.

The TypeORM docs say of `synchronize`: "don't use this in production - otherwise you can lose production data."

**Example 19 — edge case: an `undefined` value in a `where` (changed in v1.0).**

typescript

```
// src/undefined-where.ts — an undefined value in a find() where clause
import { IsNull } from 'typeorm';
import { AppDataSource, queries } from './data-source.js';
import { Post } from './entities.js';

async function main() {
  await AppDataSource.initialize();
  const posts = AppDataSource.getRepository(Post);
  const authorIdFromRequest: number | undefined = undefined;   // e.g. a missing query param

  try {
    const rows = await posts.findBy({ authorId: authorIdFromRequest });
    console.log('rows:', rows.length);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log((err as Error).constructor.name, '-', (err as Error).message);
  }

  // QueryBuilder .where() is not covered by the setting (changed in 1.0)
  queries.length = 0;
  const viaQb = await posts.createQueryBuilder('p')
    .where('p.authorId = :id', { id: authorIdFromRequest }).getMany();
  console.log('QueryBuilder rows:', viaQb.length, '\n  ', queries[0].replace(/^SELECT .* FROM/, 'SELECT … FROM'));

  // matching NULL has to be explicit
  console.log('IsNull():', (await posts.findBy({ title: IsNull() })).length);
  await AppDataSource.destroy();
}
main();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0, TypeORM 1.1.2, TypeScript 7.0.2, PostgreSQL 18.4), `node dist/undefined-where.js`:
//   TypeORMError - Undefined value encountered in property 'Post.authorId' of a where condition. Set 'invalidWhereValuesBehavior.undefined' to 'ignore' in connection options to skip properties with undefined values.
//   QueryBuilder rows: 0
//      SELECT … FROM "posts" "p" WHERE "p"."author_id" = $1 -- [null]
//   IsNull(): 0
```

The v1.0 release notes: "passing null or undefined in where conditions now throws an error instead of silently ignoring the property". The same file compiled against typeorm@0.3.31 printed `rows: 4`: the condition was dropped and every post came back. That is a serious failure mode for `delete` and `update`. The setting does not cover QueryBuilder `.where()`, which sent `$1 = null` and matched nothing.

## Common mistakes & gotchas

- **Leaving Sequelize's timestamps on.** `define()` adds `createdAt`/`updatedAt` by default. On these tables the first `findAll` fails with `column "createdAt" does not exist`. Set `timestamps: false` globally (`define: { timestamps: false }`) or per model, and map real columns with `field: 'created_at'`.
- **`paranoid: true` with `timestamps: false`.** No error, and no soft delete either: `destroy()` issued a real `DELETE` (Example 7).
- **`sync({ alter: true })` / `synchronize: true` outside a scratch database.** They make the table match the model by dropping what the model does not declare. That included `author_id` and its foreign key (Sequelize), and a `published` flag on every row (TypeORM).
- **Trusting TypeORM's rename detection.** It renames only when exactly one column changed in that table. A rename shipped alongside any other column change becomes `DROP` + `ADD`.
- **A query that skips the transaction.** A Sequelize call without `{ transaction: t }`, or a TypeORM call through the global repository instead of `manager` / `queryRunner.manager`, runs on another connection and is not rolled back.
- **N+1 through accessors.** `post.getAuthor()` or `findOneBy` in a loop costs one round trip per row: 9 queries for 4 posts here. Use `include` / `relations`, or the batched modes `separate: true` / `relationLoadStrategy: 'query'`.
- **`include`/`relations` + `limit` in Sequelize.** `subQuery: false` limits joined rows. A `'$nested.column$'` filter with a limit fails with `missing FROM-clause entry`.
- **TypeORM `.limit()` with joins.** It limits rows, not entities. Use `.take()`.
- **`eager: true` as a convenience.** It adds the JOIN to every `find*` call, even ones that do not need the relation. Meanwhile QueryBuilder silently ignores it.
- **`@VirtualColumn` is not free.** Its sub-query runs in every `SELECT` of the entity, including the `SELECT DISTINCT` pagination query.
- **Copying 0.3 TypeORM code into 1.x.** `relations: ['author']`, `loadRelationCountAndMap`, `getRepository()` globals and `findByIds` are gone (removed in v1.0).
- **Expecting `migration:generate` from sequelize-cli to read your models.** It writes an empty skeleton. Only TypeORM's generator diffs.

## Best practices

- Pick the stable line deliberately: `sequelize@6` (v7 is still alpha as `@sequelize/core`), and `typeorm@1` for new TypeORM code. Pin exact versions and record them.
- On an existing schema, declare everything: `tableName`, `timestamps: false`, `field` mappings, explicit `foreignKey` / `@JoinColumn` / `@JoinTable` names. Then compare the logged SQL with the real tables once.
- Change schemas only with migrations. Review every file `typeorm migration:generate` writes; for renames, edit it to a `RENAME COLUMN`. Run `migration:generate --check` in CI.
- Keep `sync()` / `synchronize` for tests and throwaway databases. Never point them at shared data.
- Turn on query logging in development and in tests, and assert query counts for list endpoints, so N+1 shows up as a failing number.
- Use the managed transaction form by default. When you need the unmanaged form, put `rollback` in `catch` and `release()` in `finally`.
- For pagination with to-many relations: Sequelize `separate: true` or the default subquery, but no `$nested$` filters; TypeORM `take`/`skip`, not `limit`/`offset`.
- When a query is mostly aggregation, write it with the query builder (TypeORM) or `literal`/raw SQL (Sequelize), or use a query builder such as [Knex](104-knex-query-builder.md). Lesson [106](106-choosing-raw-sql-query-builder-or-orm.md) compares the options.

## ⭐ Interview lens

> **Q: “What does `sync({ alter: true })` or `synchronize: true` actually do, and why not run it in production?”**
> A: At startup it reads the live table definitions, diffs them against the model or entity metadata, and issues `ALTER TABLE` until they match. Columns the model does not declare get dropped. Sequelize has no rename detection. TypeORM renames only when exactly one column per table changed, and otherwise drops the old column and adds the new one. On a seeded table that lost `title`, `body` and `author_id` (Sequelize) and reset every post's `published` flag (TypeORM). Use reviewed migrations instead. *Trap:* "TypeORM detects renames, so it's safe." It does, but only for a lone rename.

> **Q: “Your list endpoint makes 1 + 2N queries. How do you find and fix it?”**
> A: Log every query (Sequelize's `logging` callback, a TypeORM `Logger`) and count per request. The usual cause is `post.getAuthor()` or `findOneBy` inside a loop. You can fix it with a JOIN (`include` / `relations`, one query) or with one batched `IN (…)` query per relation (`separate: true` / `relationLoadStrategy: 'query'`). Here that took 9 queries down to 1 or 2 (Sequelize) and 1 or 4 (TypeORM).

> **Q: “Why does Sequelize put a subquery in my query when I add `limit` to an `include`?”**
> A: A to-many JOIN produces one row per child, so a plain `LIMIT` would count joined rows. Sequelize limits `posts` in a subquery and joins the children outside it. `subQuery: false` removes that and limits joined rows instead. A `$nested.column$` filter then lands inside the subquery and fails, because the child table is not joined there.

> **Q: “How do you make sure every query runs inside the transaction?”**
> A: Each transaction is one pooled connection, and only queries routed to it are part of it: `{ transaction: t }` on every Sequelize call, the `manager` argument or `queryRunner.manager` in TypeORM. A call through the global model or repository runs on another connection. It sees committed data only, and it is not rolled back.

> **Q: “Why does TypeORM need `tsc` when Node can run TypeScript?”**
> A: TypeORM's mapping is built from decorators plus `emitDecoratorMetadata` type metadata. Node's type stripping only removes types, and decorators are a parser error there. `tsc` with `experimentalDecorators` and `emitDecoratorMetadata` compiles the decorators into function calls and emits `design:type` metadata.

## Cheat-card

- **Versions:** `sequelize` 6.37.8 is stable; v7 = `@sequelize/core` 7.0.0-alpha.48 (npm `latest` is an alpha). `typeorm` 1.1.2 (1.x since 2026-05-19; 0.3 = `legacy`).
- **Sequelize on an existing schema:** `tableName`, `timestamps: false`, `field: 'created_at'`, `foreignKey: 'author_id'`, `belongsToMany(Tag, { through: 'post_tags', foreignKey, otherKey })`.
- **TypeORM mapping:** `@Entity('posts')`, `@ManyToOne` + `@JoinColumn({ name: 'author_id' })`, `@ManyToMany` + `@JoinTable({ name: 'post_tags', joinColumn, inverseJoinColumn })`; compile with `tsc` (decorator flags on).
- **Migrations:** `sequelize-cli migration:generate` = empty skeleton → `db:migrate` → `SequelizeMeta`. `typeorm migration:generate <path> -d dist/data-source.js` = diff → `migration:run` (one transaction) → `migrations`; `--check` for CI.
- **Transactions:** managed callback commits/rolls back; unmanaged = you commit/rollback (+ `release()` for a QueryRunner). Route every query: `{ transaction: t }` / `manager`.
- **N+1:** accessors in a loop = 1 + 2N. Fix: JOIN (`include` / `relations`) or batched (`separate: true` / `relationLoadStrategy: 'query'`).
- **Limits with to-many joins:** Sequelize subquery (no `$nested$` filters); TypeORM `take`/`skip`, not `limit`.
- **Never in production:** `sync({ alter: true })`, `synchronize: true`. TypeORM renames only a lone single-column change.
- **v1.0 changes:** `undefined` in `find` where throws; non-nullable ManyToOne → `INNER JOIN`; `@VirtualColumn` replaces `loadRelationCountAndMap`.
