## Why it matters

HTTP, PostgreSQL, Redis, MySQL, SMTP and the WebSocket protocol all run on top of TCP. Lesson 30 shows `http.createServer` handing you a `req` and a `res`, but underneath each pair is a `net.Socket` that the HTTP parser reads bytes from. When you write a database driver, a proxy, a custom protocol between two services, or a test double for a TCP service, you work with that socket directly through `node:net`.

TCP gives you a reliable, ordered **byte stream**, and nothing more. It does not keep message boundaries. If the client calls `write('hello')` and then `write('world')`, the server can get one `'data'` event with `helloworld`, or `hel` followed by `loworld`. Code that treats one `'data'` event as one message works on a quiet laptop and breaks under load, on a slow link, or as soon as a message is larger than about 64 KiB. Socket code also breaks in other common ways:

- it ignores `write()` returning `false`, so a slow reader makes the process buffer gigabytes;
- it expects `setTimeout` to close idle sockets (it does not);
- it closes with `destroy()` and loses data still in the queue;
- it crashes on an unhandled `ECONNRESET`.

## The concept, simply

`node:net` has two classes:

- **`net.Server`**: a listening socket. `server.listen(port, host)` asks the kernel to accept TCP connections on that address. For each accepted connection the server emits `'connection'` with a new `net.Socket`.
- **`net.Socket`**: one TCP connection, from either side. `net.createConnection({ host, port })` (alias `net.connect`) creates a client socket and starts the three-way handshake. The server gets the same kind of object for its end.

A `net.Socket` is a **Duplex stream**: it is a Readable and a Writable in one object, and the two sides are independent. The readable side holds the bytes the peer sent you; you read them with `'data'`, `pipe()` or `for await`. The writable side holds the bytes you send; you write them with `write()` and `end()`. Each side has its own buffer, its own `highWaterMark` (64 KiB by default), and its own end. The readable side ends when the peer sends a FIN (`'end'`). The writable side ends when you call `end()`, which sends your FIN. The two directions have no link between them, which is why TCP allows a "half-open" connection where one direction is closed and the other still carries data.

![The four Node stream types; the Duplex panel shows a TCP socket with independent read and write channels](assets/i23_02_ec427c97.svg)
*Figure: Readable, Writable, Duplex and Transform streams. Look at: the Duplex panel, "TCP socket — two channels, in and out unrelated", which is exactly what a `net.Socket` is.*

Underneath, each socket is a file descriptor that libuv watches with epoll (Linux), kqueue (macOS) or IOCP (Windows). No thread-pool thread is used for socket I/O. When the kernel has bytes for you, libuv reads up to 64 KiB into a Buffer and the socket emits `'data'`. When you write, libuv tries to hand the bytes to the kernel's send buffer right away and queues what does not fit.

## How it works

1. **Listen.** `server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1')` binds and listens. Port `0` makes the kernel pick a free port; read it back with `server.address().port`. `'listening'` fires when the socket is ready.
2. **Connect.** The client resolves the host name with `dns.lookup()` (see `81-dns-module.md`), then sends SYN. The kernel on the server side completes the handshake and puts the connection in the accept queue, even before Node calls `accept()`.
3. **Accept.** libuv accepts the connection and the server emits `'connection'` with a `net.Socket`. The client emits `'connect'`, then `'ready'`.
4. **Exchange bytes.** `socket.write(data)` copies bytes towards the kernel; the peer's kernel acknowledges them; the peer's Node reads whatever has arrived and emits `'data'` with a chunk of any size from 1 byte to 64 KiB. Write boundaries are not kept.
5. **Half-close.** `socket.end()` sends FIN: "I will write nothing more". The peer gets `'end'` on its readable side. By default (`allowHalfOpen: false`) the peer's socket then ends its own writable side automatically, on the next tick.
6. **Close.** When both directions are finished, or someone calls `destroy()`, the file descriptor is closed and `'close'` fires once, with `hadError` set to `true` if an error caused the close.

The handshake, the data phase and the two ways to finish look like this on the wire:

text

```
 client (net.connect)                                server (net.createServer)
   │ ── SYN ─────────────────────────────────────────► │  kernel: half-open queue
   │ ◄──────────────────────────────────── SYN+ACK ─── │
   │ ── ACK ─────────────────────────────────────────► │  kernel: accept queue
   │ 'connect'                                         │  'connection' (socket)
   │ ══ bytes in both directions, no message edges ═══ │  'data' chunks of any size
   │ ── FIN ─────────────────────────────────────────► │  client.end()  → server 'end'
   │ ◄──────────────── bytes still allowed (half-open) │  only if server allowHalfOpen
   │ ◄──────────────────────────────────────── FIN ─── │  server.end()  → client 'end'
   │ 'close' (hadError=false)                          │  'close' (hadError=false)

 abortive close instead of FIN:
   │ ── RST ─────────────────────────────────────────► │  resetAndDestroy()
   │                                                   │  'error' ECONNRESET, 'close' (hadError=true)
```

**Framing is your job.** Because TCP delivers a byte stream, a protocol on top of it must mark where each message ends. There are two common ways:

- **Length-prefixed**: each message starts with a fixed-size header that holds the body length, for example 4 bytes as an unsigned big-endian integer. The reader collects bytes until it has the 4-byte header, reads the length, then waits until the whole body has arrived. Binary-safe; the body may contain any bytes. PostgreSQL's wire protocol works this way (a 1-byte message type, then a 4-byte length).
- **Delimiter-based**: each message ends with a byte that cannot appear inside a message, usually `\n` (SMTP, IRC and line-delimited JSON end each message with a line ending). The reader keeps the unfinished tail after the last delimiter and puts it in front of the next chunk. Text only, unless you escape the delimiter.

Both readers need the same three parts: a buffer that carries leftover bytes between `'data'` events, a loop that emits every complete message in the buffer, and a maximum size, so that a client that never sends the delimiter (or sends a length of 4 GB) cannot make you buffer without limit. A text reader also needs a `StringDecoder`, because a chunk can end in the middle of a multi-byte UTF-8 character.

text

```
 app writes:      write("alpha")      write("beta")      write("héllo")
 bytes on wire:   a l p h a b e t a h é é l l o           (é is 2 bytes; no edges)
 'data' events:   [a l p h a b e] [t a h é] [é l l o]     (any cut is possible)

 length-prefixed: [00 00 00 05] a l p h a [00 00 00 04] b e t a [00 00 00 06] h é é l l o
 line-delimited:  a l p h a \n b e t a \n h é é l l o \n
```

**Backpressure.** `socket.write()` returns `true` if the data went to the kernel's send buffer, and `false` if all or part of it had to be queued in Node's memory and that queue is now at or above `writableHighWaterMark` (64 KiB). The kernel's buffers come first: on loopback the send buffer of the writer and the receive buffer of the reader together hold a few megabytes, so `write()` keeps returning `true` long after the reader stopped reading. Once they are full, every further write grows `socket.writableLength`, the number of bytes queued in Node. `write()` never refuses data: if you keep writing after `false`, memory grows without limit. A correct writer stops when `write()` returns `false` and continues on `'drain'`, which fires when the queue has been flushed to the kernel. `pipe()` and `stream.pipeline()` do this for you.

![A fast readable pushes into a slow writable; write() returns false, the source pauses, the buffer empties, 'drain' fires and the source resumes](assets/i26_01_e8e417ed.svg)
*Figure: the backpressure loop between a fast producer and a slow sink. Look at: the `write() → false` → pause → `'drain'` → resume cycle; on a socket the "slow sink" is the network plus the peer that is not reading.*

**Half-open connections and closing.** `end()` sends FIN after every queued byte has been written; the peer still receives all of it. `destroy()` closes the file descriptor now. Data still queued in Node is dropped, and the kernel sends a FIN for what it already holds. `resetAndDestroy()` (added in v18.3.0) sends RST: the peer gets `ECONNRESET`, and data still in the kernel buffers is discarded too. With `allowHalfOpen: false` (the default for both `net.createServer` and `new net.Socket`), a socket that receives FIN ends its own writable side on the next tick. Set `allowHalfOpen: true` when a reply has to be written after the peer has finished sending, for example a request/response protocol where the client signals "end of request" with `end()`.

**Timeouts and keepalive are different mechanisms.**

- `socket.setTimeout(ms)` is a Node timer that restarts on every read or write. When it fires, the socket emits `'timeout'` and **nothing else happens**: the connection stays open until you call `end()` or `destroy()`.
- `socket.setKeepAlive(true, initialDelay)` sets kernel options (`SO_KEEPALIVE`, `TCP_KEEPIDLE`) so that the kernel sends empty probe packets on an idle connection and reports the connection as dead if the probes go unanswered. Its purpose is to detect a peer that vanished (power loss, a NAT entry that expired), not to close idle clients.
- In v24.19.0, `setKeepAlive` also takes `interval` and `count` (`TCP_KEEPINTVL`, `TCP_KEEPCNT`) and an options-object form `setKeepAlive({ enable, initialDelay, interval, count })` (both added in v24.19.0). The `keepAlive`, `keepAliveInitialDelay` and `noDelay` options of `net.createServer` and `net.createConnection` were added in v17.7.0 / v16.15.0.

**Nagle and `setNoDelay`.** By default the kernel uses Nagle's algorithm: while some sent data is still unacknowledged, it holds back small writes and merges them into one segment. `socket.setNoDelay(true)` (or the `noDelay: true` option) turns that off, so each write goes out as soon as possible. This lowers latency for small interactive messages. It does not give you message boundaries: the receiver can still merge or split segments.

**Errors and `'close'`.** A socket emits `'error'` and then `'close'` with `hadError === true`. Without an `'error'` listener, the error is thrown and the process crashes (see lesson 54). The common codes:

- `ECONNREFUSED`: you connected to a port where nothing listens, so the peer kernel answered with RST.
- `ECONNRESET`: the peer reset an open connection, for example a crash, `resetAndDestroy()`, or a close while unread data was still in its receive buffer.
- `ETIMEDOUT`: the kernel gave up on the handshake or on keepalive probes.
- `EPIPE`: you wrote after the peer had already closed.

A clean close emits `'end'` (the peer's FIN) and then `'close'` with `hadError === false`.

## Code examples

**Example 1 — a server, a client, and the socket as a Duplex.**

javascript

```
import net from 'node:net';
import { Duplex } from 'node:stream';

// Server: uppercase every chunk it receives and send it back.
const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  console.log('server: connection from', socket.remoteAddress);
  console.log('server: socket is a Duplex?', socket instanceof Duplex);
  socket.on('data', (chunk) => socket.write(chunk.toString().toUpperCase()));
  socket.on('end', () => console.log('server: client sent FIN'));
});

server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1', () => {          // port 0: the OS picks a free port
  const { port } = server.address();

  const client = net.createConnection({ port, host: '127.0.0.1' }, () => {
    console.log('client: connected, readyState =', client.readyState);
    client.write('hello over tcp');
  });
  client.setEncoding('utf8');
  client.on('data', (text) => {
    console.log('client: got', JSON.stringify(text));
    client.end();                       // send FIN: "I have nothing more to write"
  });
  client.on('close', (hadError) => {
    console.log('client: closed, hadError =', hadError);
    server.close(() => console.log('server: closed'));
  });
});

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   server: connection from 127.0.0.1
//   server: socket is a Duplex? true
//   client: connected, readyState = open
//   client: got "HELLO OVER TCP"
//   server: client sent FIN
//   client: closed, hadError = false
//   server: closed
```

The client's `end()` sends FIN; the server's socket gets `'end'` and, because `allowHalfOpen` is `false`, ends its own side, which lets the client see `'close'`.

**Example 2 — edge case: writes merge and messages split.** The server below only counts what arrives. Run A makes five `write()` calls in the same tick; run B makes them 20 ms apart with Nagle disabled; run C makes one 1 MiB `write()`.

javascript

```
import net from 'node:net';
import { once } from 'node:events';

// The server only counts what arrives: how many 'data' events, how many bytes.
const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  const sizes = [];
  socket.on('data', (chunk) => sizes.push(chunk.length));
  socket.on('end', () => {
    const shown = sizes.length > 6 ? `${sizes.slice(0, 5).join(', ')}, …` : sizes.join(', ');
    console.log(`  server saw ${sizes.length} 'data' event(s), ${sizes.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)} bytes: [${shown}]`);
    socket.end();
  });
});
server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1');
await once(server, 'listening');
const { port } = server.address();

async function run(label, send) {
  console.log(label);
  const c = net.createConnection({ port, host: '127.0.0.1' });
  await once(c, 'connect');
  await send(c);
  c.end();
  await once(c, 'close');
}

// A: five separate write() calls in the same tick, 10 bytes each
await run('A: 5 writes of 10 bytes, same tick', async (c) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) c.write(`message-${i}`.padEnd(10, '.'));
});

// B: the same five writes, 20 ms apart, with Nagle disabled
await run('B: 5 writes of 10 bytes, 20 ms apart, setNoDelay(true)', async (c) => {
  c.setNoDelay(true);
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    c.write(`message-${i}`.padEnd(10, '.'));
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 20));
  }
});

// C: ONE write() of 1 MiB
await run('C: 1 write of 1 MiB', async (c) => { c.write(Buffer.alloc(1024 * 1024, 'x')); });

server.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   A: 5 writes of 10 bytes, same tick
//     server saw 1 'data' event(s), 50 bytes: [50]
//   B: 5 writes of 10 bytes, 20 ms apart, setNoDelay(true)
//     server saw 5 'data' event(s), 50 bytes: [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
//   C: 1 write of 1 MiB
//     server saw 18 'data' event(s), 1048576 bytes: [65536, 65536, 64485, 65536, 65536, …]
```

Five writes in one tick arrived as **one** 50-byte `'data'` event. Spacing the same writes out produced five events, but that came from timing, not from TCP: on a busy network or a busy receiver they merge again. One 1 MiB write arrived as many chunks of at most 64 KiB, and the count changes from run to run (17 and 18 in two runs on this machine). Any protocol that maps one `'data'` event to one message fails in cases A and C.

**Example 3 — length-prefixed framing that survives both cases.**

javascript

```
import net from 'node:net';
import { once } from 'node:events';

// Frame = 4-byte unsigned big-endian length + that many bytes of payload.
function encodeFrame(text) {
  const body = Buffer.from(text, 'utf8');
  const header = Buffer.alloc(4);
  header.writeUInt32BE(body.length);
  return Buffer.concat([header, body]);
}

// Decoder: keeps leftover bytes between 'data' events and emits whole frames only.
function createFrameDecoder(onFrame, maxFrame = 1024 * 1024) {
  let pending = Buffer.alloc(0);
  return (chunk) => {
    pending = pending.length ? Buffer.concat([pending, chunk]) : chunk;
    while (pending.length >= 4) {
      const len = pending.readUInt32BE(0);
      if (len > maxFrame) throw new Error(`frame of ${len} bytes is over the limit`);
      if (pending.length < 4 + len) break;          // body not complete yet: wait
      onFrame(pending.subarray(4, 4 + len).toString('utf8'));
      pending = pending.subarray(4 + len);
    }
  };
}

const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  let chunks = 0;
  const decode = createFrameDecoder((msg) => console.log(`  frame: ${JSON.stringify(msg)}`));
  socket.on('data', (chunk) => { chunks++; decode(chunk); });
  socket.on('end', () => { console.log(`  (${chunks} 'data' events)`); socket.end(); });
});
server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1');
await once(server, 'listening');
const { port } = server.address();

async function run(label, send) {
  console.log(label);
  const c = net.createConnection({ port, host: '127.0.0.1', noDelay: true });
  await once(c, 'connect');
  await send(c);
  c.end();
  await once(c, 'close');
}

// 1. Three frames glued into one write
await run('three frames in one write():', async (c) => {
  c.write(Buffer.concat(['alpha', 'beta', 'héllo, wörld'].map(encodeFrame)));
});

// 2. One frame sent 3 bytes at a time, 5 ms apart: the header and a 2-byte
//    UTF-8 character are cut across 'data' events
await run('one frame dripped 3 bytes at a time:', async (c) => {
  const bytes = encodeFrame('héllo');
  for (let i = 0; i < bytes.length; i += 3) {
    c.write(bytes.subarray(i, i + 3));
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 5));
  }
});

server.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   three frames in one write():
//     frame: "alpha"
//     frame: "beta"
//     frame: "héllo, wörld"
//     (1 'data' events)
//   one frame dripped 3 bytes at a time:
//     frame: "héllo"
//     (4 'data' events)
```

Three frames in one chunk come out as three messages, and one frame cut into four chunks (with the 4-byte header and the 2-byte `é` both split) comes out as one message. The decoder decodes UTF-8 only after the whole body has arrived, so a split character cannot be corrupted. It checks the declared length against `maxFrame` before it waits for the body, so a client that sends a huge length is rejected at once.

**Example 4 — delimiter-based framing: the naive split versus a line splitter.**

javascript

```
import net from 'node:net';
import { once } from 'node:events';
import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';

// Correct: decode bytes safely, keep the unfinished tail, cap the line length.
function createLineSplitter(onLine, maxLine = 8 * 1024) {
  const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');  // holds a split multi-byte char
  let tail = '';
  return (chunk) => {
    const parts = (tail + decoder.write(chunk)).split('\n');
    tail = parts.pop();                          // last piece has no '\n' yet
    if (tail.length > maxLine) throw new Error('line too long');
    for (const line of parts) onLine(line.replace(/\r$/, ''));
  };
}

const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  const split = createLineSplitter((line) => console.log(`  fixed: ${JSON.stringify(line)}`));
  socket.on('data', (chunk) => {
    // Wrong: treat every chunk as whole lines
    for (const line of chunk.toString('utf8').split('\n').filter(Boolean)) {
      console.log(`  naive: ${JSON.stringify(line)}`);
    }
    split(chunk);
  });
  socket.on('end', () => socket.end());
});
server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1');
await once(server, 'listening');

const c = net.createConnection({ port: server.address().port, host: '127.0.0.1', noDelay: true });
await once(c, 'connect');
const bytes = Buffer.from('first line\nsecond line\ncafé\n', 'utf8');
// cut after "second li" and in the middle of the 2-byte "é"
for (const piece of [bytes.subarray(0, 20), bytes.subarray(20, 27), bytes.subarray(27)]) {
  c.write(piece);
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 10));
}
c.end();
await once(c, 'close');
server.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//     naive: "first line"
//     naive: "second li"
//     fixed: "first line"
//     naive: "ne"
//     naive: "caf�"
//     fixed: "second line"
//     naive: "�"
//     fixed: "café"
```

The naive version prints `"second li"` and `"ne"` as two messages, and turns the `é` that was cut across two chunks into two replacement characters. The splitter keeps the unfinished `tail`, and its `StringDecoder` holds back the first byte of `é` until the second byte arrives. This is the same fix lesson 28 applies to its CSV transform.

**Example 5 — backpressure on a socket: `write()` returns `false`, `writableLength` grows, `'drain'` fires.**

javascript

```
import net from 'node:net';
import { once } from 'node:events';

const MiB = 1024 * 1024;
let serverSocket;
const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  serverSocket = socket;
  socket.pause();                 // a slow consumer: read nothing for now
  let got = 0;
  socket.on('data', (c) => { got += c.length; });
  socket.on('end', () => { console.log(`server: received ${(got / MiB).toFixed(2)} MiB in total`); socket.end(); });
});
server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1');
await once(server, 'listening');

const client = net.createConnection({ port: server.address().port, host: '127.0.0.1' });
await once(client, 'connect');
console.log('client: writableHighWaterMark =', client.writableHighWaterMark);

const chunk = Buffer.alloc(64 * 1024, 'x');
let sent = 0;
// Keep writing until write() says stop. The kernel's send and receive
// buffers absorb the first megabytes, so false comes late.
while (client.write(chunk)) sent += chunk.length;
sent += chunk.length;
console.log(`client: write() returned false after ${(sent / MiB).toFixed(2)} MiB`);
console.log(`client: writableLength = ${client.writableLength} bytes queued in Node's memory`);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('server: resume() — start reading');
  serverSocket.resume();
}, 200);

const t0 = Date.now();
await once(client, 'drain');
console.log(`client: 'drain' after ${Math.round((Date.now() - t0) / 100) * 100} ms, writableLength = ${client.writableLength}`);
client.end();
await once(client, 'close');
server.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   client: writableHighWaterMark = 65536
//   client: write() returned false after 2.56 MiB
//   client: writableLength = 65536 bytes queued in Node's memory
//   server: resume() — start reading
//   client: 'drain' after 200 ms, writableLength = 0
//   server: received 2.56 MiB in total
```

The reader paused, yet the writer got `true` for about 2.5 MiB, because the kernel buffers on both sides of the loopback connection took that much. The exact amount depends on the kernel's `net.ipv4.tcp_wmem` / `tcp_rmem` settings. Only after that did 64 KiB pile up in Node (`writableLength` reached `writableHighWaterMark`) and `write()` return `false`. A loop that ignored the `false` would keep growing `writableLength`. Once the reader resumed, the queue drained and `'drain'` fired.

**Example 6 — edge case: `allowHalfOpen` and a reply that is computed after the client's FIN.**

javascript

```
import net from 'node:net';
import { once } from 'node:events';

// A "sum" service: the client sends numbers, then end(). The server answers
// only after it has seen the client's FIN, because only then is the input complete.
async function trial(allowHalfOpen) {
  console.log(`--- server allowHalfOpen: ${allowHalfOpen}`);
  const server = net.createServer({ allowHalfOpen }, (socket) => {
    let input = '';
    socket.setEncoding('utf8');
    socket.on('data', (d) => { input += d; });
    socket.on('end', () => {
      console.log(`server: 'end' (client FIN). readyState = ${socket.readyState}, writable = ${socket.writable}`);
      const sum = input.trim().split(/\s+/).map(Number).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
      setTimeout(() => {                 // pretend the answer needs a 10 ms DB call
        console.log(`server: replying 10 ms later. readyState = ${socket.readyState}`);
        socket.end(`sum=${sum}\n`, (err) => console.log('server: end() callback, err =', err?.code ?? null));
      }, 10);
    });
    socket.on('error', (err) => console.log('server: error', err.code));
  });
  server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1');
  await once(server, 'listening');

  const client = net.createConnection({ port: server.address().port, host: '127.0.0.1' });
  client.setEncoding('utf8');
  let reply = '';
  client.on('data', (d) => { reply += d; });
  client.on('end', () => console.log('client: server sent FIN'));
  await once(client, 'connect');
  client.end('2 3 4');                 // write, then half-close our side
  const [hadError] = await once(client, 'close');
  console.log(`client: reply = ${JSON.stringify(reply)}, hadError = ${hadError}`);
  server.close();
}

await trial(true);
await trial(false);

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   --- server allowHalfOpen: true
//   server: 'end' (client FIN). readyState = writeOnly, writable = true
//   server: replying 10 ms later. readyState = writeOnly
//   server: end() callback, err = null
//   client: server sent FIN
//   client: reply = "sum=9\n", hadError = false
//   --- server allowHalfOpen: false
//   server: 'end' (client FIN). readyState = writeOnly, writable = true
//   client: server sent FIN
//   client: reply = "", hadError = false
//   server: replying 10 ms later. readyState = closed
//   server: end() callback, err = ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END
```

With `allowHalfOpen: true`, the server's writable side stays open after the client's FIN, so the reply sent 10 ms later arrives. With the default `false`, Node ends the writable side on the tick after `'end'`. A reply written synchronously inside the `'end'` handler still goes out, which is why this bug hides in tests. A reply that waits for anything asynchronous (a timer, a database query) finds the socket already closed: the client gets an empty reply, and the only trace on the server is `ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END` passed to the `end()` callback.

**Example 7 — `end()` vs `destroy()` vs `resetAndDestroy()`, and `ECONNREFUSED`.** Each client writes 8 MiB, then closes in a different way.

javascript

```
import net from 'node:net';
import { once } from 'node:events';

const MiB = 1024 * 1024;
const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  let got = 0;
  socket.on('data', (c) => { got += c.length; });
  socket.on('end', () => console.log(`  server: 'end' (FIN received)`));
  socket.on('error', (err) => console.log(`  server: 'error' ${err.code}`));
  socket.on('close', (hadError) =>
    console.log(`  server: 'close' hadError=${hadError}, received ${(got / MiB).toFixed(2)} MiB`));
});
server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1');
await once(server, 'listening');
const { port } = server.address();

async function trial(label, finish) {
  console.log(label);
  const c = net.createConnection({ port, host: '127.0.0.1' });
  c.on('error', (err) => console.log(`  client: 'error' ${err.code}`));
  await once(c, 'connect');
  c.write(Buffer.alloc(8 * MiB));          // more than the kernel buffers hold at once
  finish(c);
  await once(c, 'close');
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 50));   // let the server log
}

await trial('end(): flush the queue, then FIN', (c) => c.end());
await trial('destroy(): close now, drop what is still queued', (c) => c.destroy());
await trial('resetAndDestroy(): send RST', (c) => c.resetAndDestroy());
server.close();
await once(server, 'close');

// Nobody listens on this port any more
console.log('connect to a closed port');
const r = net.createConnection({ port, host: '127.0.0.1' });
r.on('error', (err) => console.log(`  client: 'error' ${err.code} (syscall=${err.syscall}, address=${err.address})`));
r.on('close', (hadError) => console.log(`  client: 'close' hadError=${hadError}`));

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   end(): flush the queue, then FIN
//     server: 'end' (FIN received)
//     server: 'close' hadError=false, received 8.00 MiB
//   destroy(): close now, drop what is still queued
//     server: 'end' (FIN received)
//     server: 'close' hadError=false, received 2.51 MiB
//   resetAndDestroy(): send RST
//     server: 'error' ECONNRESET
//     server: 'close' hadError=true, received 0.12 MiB
//   connect to a closed port
//     client: 'error' ECONNREFUSED (syscall=connect, address=127.0.0.1)
//     client: 'close' hadError=true
```

`end()` delivered all 8 MiB. `destroy()` delivered only what the kernel had already accepted (2.51 MiB here): the rest was still in Node's queue and was thrown away, yet the server saw a normal FIN with `hadError=false`, so nothing told it that data was missing. `resetAndDestroy()` sent RST: the server got `ECONNRESET`, `hadError=true`, and even bytes already sitting in its kernel buffer were discarded. Connecting to a closed port fails with `ECONNREFUSED` from the `connect` syscall.

**Example 8 — `setTimeout` only warns; `setKeepAlive` is the kernel's job.**

javascript

```
import net from 'node:net';
import { once } from 'node:events';
import { execFileSync } from 'node:child_process';

const t0 = Date.now();
const at = () => `${String(Math.round((Date.now() - t0) / 100) * 100).padStart(4)} ms`;

const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  socket.setEncoding('utf8');
  socket.setTimeout(300);                       // idle timer: 300 ms without I/O
  let warned = false;
  socket.on('timeout', () => {
    if (!warned) {
      warned = true;
      console.log(`${at()} server: 'timeout' — destroyed=${socket.destroyed}, readyState=${socket.readyState}`);
      socket.write('are you still there?\n');   // the socket still works
      return;
    }
    console.log(`${at()} server: second 'timeout', closing it ourselves`);
    socket.end('bye\n');
  });
  socket.on('data', (d) => console.log(`${at()} server: got ${JSON.stringify(d)} (I/O resets the timer)`));
  socket.on('close', () => console.log(`${at()} server: 'close'`));
});
server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1');
await once(server, 'listening');
const { port } = server.address();

const client = net.createConnection({ port, host: '127.0.0.1' });
await once(client, 'connect');
client.setKeepAlive(true, 10_000);              // kernel probes after 10 s idle
const ss = execFileSync('ss', ['-tno', 'state', 'established', `( sport = :${client.localPort} )`], { encoding: 'utf8' });
const [, secs] = ss.match(/timer:\(keepalive,([\d.]+)sec/);   // e.g. "timer:(keepalive,9.959sec,0)"
console.log(`client: ss shows a keepalive timer, first probe in ~${Math.round(secs)} s`);

client.setEncoding('utf8');
client.on('data', (d) => {
  console.log(`${at()} client: got ${JSON.stringify(d)}`);
  if (d.startsWith('are you')) setTimeout(() => client.write('yes'), 100);
});
await once(client, 'close');
server.close();

// Real output (Node v24.19.0):
//   client: ss shows a keepalive timer, first probe in ~10 s
//    300 ms server: 'timeout' — destroyed=false, readyState=open
//    300 ms client: got "are you still there?\n"
//    400 ms server: got "yes" (I/O resets the timer)
//    700 ms server: second 'timeout', closing it ourselves
//    700 ms client: got "bye\n"
//    700 ms server: 'close'
```

After 300 ms of silence the server got `'timeout'`, yet the socket was neither destroyed nor closed, and it could still write. The client's reply reset the idle timer. The second `'timeout'` is where the server decides to close. `ss -tno` shows the kernel keepalive timer that `setKeepAlive(true, 10_000)` started on the client socket. The kernel sends those probes; Node is not involved.

To see the four kernel options that the new v24.19.0 options form sets, trace the `setsockopt` calls:

javascript

```
const net = require('node:net');
const s = net.createServer(() => {}).listen(0, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  const c = net.connect(s.address().port, '127.0.0.1', () => {
    c.setKeepAlive({ enable: true, initialDelay: 10000, interval: 2000, count: 3 });
    c.destroy(); s.close();
  });
});
```

bash

```
$ strace -f -e trace=setsockopt node ka.cjs 2>&1 | grep KEEP | sed 's/^\[pid *[0-9]*\] //'
setsockopt(22, SOL_SOCKET, SO_KEEPALIVE, [1], 4) = 0
setsockopt(22, SOL_TCP, TCP_KEEPIDLE, [10], 4) = 0
setsockopt(22, SOL_TCP, TCP_KEEPINTVL, [2], 4) = 0
setsockopt(22, SOL_TCP, TCP_KEEPCNT, [3], 4) = 0
```

The millisecond values become whole seconds (`10000` → `10`, `2000` → `2`), as the docs say. The same script on Node 22 sets only the first option, with no error:

bash

```
$ strace -f -e trace=setsockopt "$(npx -y node@22 -p process.execPath)" ka.cjs 2>&1 | grep KEEP | sed 's/^\[pid *[0-9]*\] //'
setsockopt(22, SOL_SOCKET, SO_KEEPALIVE, [1], 4) = 0
```

Node v22.23.3 has only the positional form `setKeepAlive(enable, initialDelay)`. It treats the object as a truthy `enable` and ignores the rest, so the probe delay stays at the kernel default (`net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time`, 7200 s on this machine). Check `process.version` before you rely on the options form.

**Example 9 — a line-protocol chat server.** One message is one line ending in `\n`. The first line a client sends is its nickname; `/who` lists who is online; `/quit` leaves; any other line goes to everyone else as `<nick> text`. The server combines the pieces above: a line splitter with a length limit, a backpressure policy (a client that falls 256 KiB behind is dropped), an idle timeout that really closes, and an `'error'` listener on every socket.

javascript

```
// chat-server.mjs — a line protocol over TCP. One line = one message, ended by '\n'.
//   first line      -> your nickname
//   /who            -> list who is online
//   /quit           -> leave
//   anything else   -> sent to everyone else as "<nick> text"
import net from 'node:net';
import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';

const MAX_LINE = 1024;              // bytes we accept before a '\n'
const MAX_QUEUED = 256 * 1024;      // a client further behind than this is dropped
const IDLE_MS = 5 * 60_000;

export function createChatServer({ log = console.log } = {}) {
  const clients = new Map();        // socket -> nick (only after the nick is set)

  function send(socket, line) {
    if (socket.destroyed || socket.writableEnded) return;   // after end() or destroy()
    socket.write(line + '\n');
    // Backpressure policy: one slow reader must not grow our memory without bound.
    if (socket.writableLength > MAX_QUEUED) {
      log(`server: dropping ${clients.get(socket)} (slow consumer, ${socket.writableLength} bytes queued)`);
      socket.destroy();
    }
  }
  function broadcast(from, line) {
    for (const s of clients.keys()) if (s !== from) send(s, line);
  }

  function handleLine(socket, line) {
    const nick = clients.get(socket);
    if (nick === undefined) {                       // first line: the nickname
      if (!/^\w{1,16}$/.test(line)) return send(socket, '* nick must be 1-16 letters, digits or _');
      if ([...clients.values()].includes(line)) return send(socket, `* ${line} is taken`);
      clients.set(socket, line);
      log(`server: ${line} joined (${clients.size} online)`);
      send(socket, `* hi ${line}, ${clients.size} online`);
      return broadcast(socket, `* ${line} joined`);
    }
    if (line === '/who') return send(socket, `* online: ${[...clients.values()].join(', ')}`);
    if (line === '/quit') return socket.end('* bye\n');     // FIN after the goodbye
    if (line.length) broadcast(socket, `<${nick}> ${line}`);
  }

  const server = net.createServer({ noDelay: true }, (socket) => {
    const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
    let tail = '';
    socket.setTimeout(IDLE_MS);
    socket.on('timeout', () => socket.end('* idle too long\n'));   // 'timeout' only warns
    send(socket, '* welcome, send your nick');

    socket.on('data', (chunk) => {
      const parts = (tail + decoder.write(chunk)).split('\n');
      tail = parts.pop();
      for (const line of parts) handleLine(socket, line.replace(/\r$/, ''));
      if (Buffer.byteLength(tail) > MAX_LINE) socket.end('* line too long\n');
    });
    socket.on('error', (err) => log(`server: socket error ${err.code}`));   // ECONNRESET etc.
    socket.on('close', (hadError) => {
      const nick = clients.get(socket);
      if (nick === undefined) return;
      clients.delete(socket);
      log(`server: ${nick} left (hadError=${hadError}, ${clients.size} online)`);
      broadcast(socket, `* ${nick} left`);
    });
  });
  return server;
}

if (import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}`) {
  const port = Number(process.argv[2] ?? 4900);
  createChatServer().listen(port, '127.0.0.1', function () {
    console.log(`chat server on 127.0.0.1:${this.address().port}`);
  });
}
```

The test starts the server in-process and drives three scripted clients. Each step waits for the lines it expects, so the transcript comes out in the same order on every run. Carol sends her nickname and the first half of a message in one write and the rest 20 ms later, to show that the server's framing handles both cases. Bob leaves with an RST instead of a FIN.

//   server: carol left (hadError=false, 0 online)
```

The transcript shows the framing work: `carol\nhello every` became a nickname plus a partial line, and `one\n` 20 ms later completed `hello everyone`. Alice's `/quit` was a clean close (FIN, `hadError=false`). Bob's RST reached the server as `ECONNRESET` followed by `'close'` with `hadError=true`, and the `'error'` listener kept the server running. In a separate run with one client that joined and never read while another flooded the room with 1 KB lines, the server logged `server: dropping sloth (slow consumer, 262340 bytes queued)`, so the backpressure policy holds memory per client at about 256 KiB.

Any line-based TCP client can talk to it. Here the server runs on port 4900 and `nc` sends a nickname followed by 3,000 bytes with no newline:

bash

```
$ node chat-server.mjs 4900 &
chat server on 127.0.0.1:4900
$ (printf 'dave\n'; head -c 3000 /dev/zero | tr '\0' 'a'; sleep 0.3) | nc -q1 127.0.0.1 4900
* welcome, send your nick
server: dave joined (1 online)
* hi dave, 1 online
* line too long
server: dave left (hadError=false, 0 online)
```

The complete `dave` line was handled first; then the 3,000-byte unfinished line went over `MAX_LINE`, and the server ended the connection instead of buffering it.

## Common mistakes & gotchas

- **Treating one `'data'` event as one message.** Example 2: five writes became one chunk, and one 1 MiB write became 17 or 18 chunks. Always frame: a length prefix or a delimiter, plus a buffer that carries the leftover bytes.
- **Calling `chunk.toString()` on raw chunks of text.** A multi-byte UTF-8 character can be cut across chunks and becomes `�` (Example 4). Use a `StringDecoder`, `socket.setEncoding('utf8')`, or decode only complete frames.
- **No maximum message size.** A reader that buffers "until the newline" or "until `length` bytes" can be made to hold any amount of memory by one client. Reject oversized lengths and over-long tails.
- **Ignoring `write()`'s return value.** `write()` accepts everything; `false` means "stop". If you keep writing to a slow peer, `writableLength` grows until the process runs out of memory. Wait for `'drain'`, use `pipeline()`, or drop the peer (Example 9).
- **Expecting `setTimeout` to close the socket.** It only emits `'timeout'`. Call `end()` or `destroy()` in the handler.
- **Confusing `setTimeout` with `setKeepAlive`.** The first is a Node idle timer for your own policy; the second makes the kernel detect dead peers, and its first probe comes after `initialDelay`; with `0` the kernel default applies (`net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time`, 7200 s here).
- **Answering asynchronously after `'end'` with the default `allowHalfOpen: false`.** The writable side is already ended; the reply is lost (Example 6).
- **Closing with `destroy()` when you meant `end()`.** `destroy()` drops queued data and the peer gets a normal FIN, so nothing reports the loss (Example 7).
- **No `'error'` listener on a socket.** `ECONNRESET` from one client then crashes the whole server. Every socket, server-side and client-side, needs one.
- **Thinking `setNoDelay(true)` preserves message boundaries.** It only stops the sender's kernel from delaying small writes; the receiver can still merge or split them.

## Best practices

- **Pick a framing and write it down**: a 4-byte big-endian length prefix for binary data, or `\n`-terminated lines (often line-delimited JSON) for text. Put a maximum size on both.
- **Keep the decoder separate from the socket** (a function or a Transform stream that takes chunks and emits messages), so you can unit-test it by feeding it 1-byte chunks and glued chunks, as Examples 3 and 4 do.
- **Respect backpressure on every write path.** For one-to-one copies use `pipeline(source, socket)`. For fan-out (chat, pub/sub), check `writableLength` per client and drop or slow down clients that fall behind.
- **Attach `'error'` to every socket and log `err.code`.** Treat `ECONNRESET` and `EPIPE` as normal disconnects, not as server failures.
- **Use `end()` for a graceful close** and `destroy()` only when you mean to drop the connection; use `resetAndDestroy()` when the peer must see an error.
- **Use `setTimeout` plus `end()` for idle clients** and `setKeepAlive(true, delay)` to find dead peers on long-lived connections (database pools, push channels).
- **Listen on port 0 in tests** and read the port from `server.address().port`, so parallel test runs never collide.

## ⭐ Interview lens

> **Q: “A client sends two JSON messages with two `write()` calls. Why might the server's `JSON.parse(chunk)` fail?”**  
> A: TCP is a byte stream with no message boundaries. The two writes can arrive as one `'data'` chunk (the kernel merged them) or one message can be split across chunks (a large payload, a slow link, the 64 KiB read size). You need framing: newline-delimited JSON with a carried tail, or a length prefix. *Trap:* `setNoDelay(true)` does not fix this; it only changes when the sender transmits.

> **Q: “What does `socket.write()` returning `false` mean, and what happens if you ignore it?”**  
> A: The data was accepted but queued in Node's memory because the kernel's send buffer is full, and the queue (`writableLength`) has reached `writableHighWaterMark`. If you keep writing, the queue grows without limit. Stop and resume on `'drain'`, or let `pipeline()` do it. On loopback the first `false` only comes after the kernel buffers (a few MB) are full.

> **Q: “What is the difference between `end()`, `destroy()` and `resetAndDestroy()`?”**  
> A: `end()` flushes the queue, then sends FIN; the peer gets everything plus `'end'`. `destroy()` closes now and drops whatever is still queued in Node; the peer still sees a normal FIN. `resetAndDestroy()` sends RST; the peer gets `ECONNRESET` and `'close'` with `hadError=true`, and data in kernel buffers is discarded.

> **Q: “What is a half-open connection and when do you need `allowHalfOpen: true`?”**  
> A: One direction is closed by FIN and the other still carries data. Use `allowHalfOpen: true` when the peer signals "request complete" with `end()` and you reply afterwards, especially after async work. With the default `false`, Node ends your side on the tick after `'end'`, so an async reply hits `ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END`.

> **Q: “Does `socket.setTimeout(30000)` close idle connections?”**  
> A: No. It emits `'timeout'` after 30 s without reads or writes and leaves the socket open; you call `end()` or `destroy()` yourself. Kernel keepalive (`setKeepAlive`) is a separate mechanism that detects dead peers with probe packets.

## Cheat-card

- **Server:** `net.createServer({ allowHalfOpen, keepAlive, noDelay, pauseOnConnect }, (socket) => …).listen(0, host)`; port via `server.address().port`.
- **Client:** `net.createConnection({ host, port, noDelay, keepAlive, timeout, autoSelectFamily })`; events `'lookup'`, `'connect'`, `'ready'`.
- **Socket = Duplex:** readable side ends on peer FIN (`'end'`); writable side ends on your `end()`; `readyState` `open` / `readOnly` / `writeOnly` / `closed`.
- **Chunks:** 1 byte to 64 KiB, merged or split at random; never one write = one `'data'`.
- **Framing:** length prefix (`readUInt32BE`, wait for `4 + len`) or delimiter (`split('\n')`, carry `tail`, `StringDecoder`); always a max size.
- **Backpressure:** `write()` → `false` = stop; `'drain'` = go; `writableLength` = bytes queued in Node; kernel buffers absorb MBs first.
- **Close:** `end()` = flush + FIN · `destroy()` = close now, drop queue · `resetAndDestroy()` = RST (v18.3.0).
- **Half-open:** default `allowHalfOpen: false` ends your side on the tick after `'end'`.
- **Idle:** `setTimeout(ms)` → `'timeout'` only, you close. Keepalive: `setKeepAlive(true, ms)`; `interval`/`count` and the options form added in v24.19.0.
- **Errors:** `'error'` then `'close'(hadError=true)`; `ECONNREFUSED` (nobody listening), `ECONNRESET` (peer RST), `EPIPE`, `ETIMEDOUT`. Always add an `'error'` listener.
