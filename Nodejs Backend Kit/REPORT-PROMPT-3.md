# REPORT — Prompt 3 (core modules, streams, HTTP, networking and Web APIs, 2026-10-10)

**Scope:**
- 11 new lessons, 75–85, continuing the numbering.
- `## Additional topics` sections appended to lessons 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 and 33, with Cheat-card bullets added to each.
- One Learn More link added to lessons 12, 25 and 69, pointing back to lesson 75. Those lessons already call `fetch` without explaining it.
- The README.md index updated to list all 85 lessons.

**Environment:**
- **Node:** v24.19.0, with V8 13.6.233.17-node.51, libuv 1.52.1, c-ares 1.34.6, bundled undici 7.29.0 and bundled OpenSSL 3.5.7. npm 11.17.0. Linux x64 (7.0.0-38-generic).
- **Where code ran:** every example was run in a scratch directory outside the kit, and the outputs are pasted from those runs. Version marks come from the History tables in `nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x`; `nodejs.org/api` now serves v26.

**Libraries and tools:**

**Totals:**
- 4 `> ⚠️ Unverified` lines, each next to the claim it qualifies.
- No output was pasted without being run.
- All Learn More URLs returned HTTP 200.

**Coordinator checks:**
- **Append-only:** a script diffed the 14 touched existing lessons against snapshots taken before writing. The only changes are inserted Cheat-card bullets, the single Learn More bullet and the appended tail; no existing line changed.
- **Template:** all 11 new lessons have the 9 template sections in order, with 4–5 Q&A each. Lessons 78 and 79 each had an extra `##` section; I folded both into Code examples as Example 7 and Example 9.
- **Line endings:** CRLF everywhere.
- **Marketing words:** none.
- **Independent re-run:** I re-ran 8 sample blocks myself, from lessons 79, 84, 85, 80, 82 and the 22, 23 and 28 appendices. All 81 expected output lines were found verbatim.

**Assignment correction:** the coordinator's brief named `assets/i30_02_76f1c6dd.svg`, which does not exist. Writer H found the correct file, `assets/i30_02_0d3eb5e7.svg` (the "HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 over one connection" figure), and embedded that.

## ASSET_ISSUES rows added

None. Every embedded figure agrees with its text. The existing `i24_02` issue ("default 16 KB") was left alone in lesson 27 and was not re-embedded.

## MISSING_DIAGRAMS rows added (9)

| Lesson | Concept |
|---|---|
| 75 | undici dispatcher hierarchy |
| 76 | TCP connection lifecycle |
| 76 | Message framing over a byte stream |
| 77 | UDP datagrams vs the TCP stream |
| 80 | HTTP content negotiation |
| 81 | Full DNS resolution path |
| 83 | Web Streams vs Node streams |
| 32 (appendix) | Path-traversal guard pipeline |
| 33 (appendix) | Mutual TLS handshake (TLS 1.3) |

The full "what the diagram should show" text for each row is in MISSING_DIAGRAMS.md.

## Found but not changed (outside this prompt)

This prompt only allowed appending, so these original lines were left as they are. Where an appendix covers the point, it says so.

- **23:** says the Buffer pool is 8 KB with a 4 KB threshold. Since v24.18.0 the default `Buffer.poolSize` is 65536, so the threshold is 32 KiB. I checked this myself: v24.17.0 prints 8192 and v24.19.0 prints 65536, and the docs History confirms it. The Cheat-card line "`slice`/`subarray` share memory" is true only for Buffer.
- **22:** recommends `os.cpus().length` for sizing pools, which contradicts the 07 and 22 appendices (`availableParallelism()`).
- **Scrape-broken string literals:** `'\n'` literals broken across lines remain in 27 (Examples 1–4, plus stray lines after a `// prints 1` comment), 30 and 33. Lesson 28's Interview lens Q3 is missing a `\n` in "when you see a , so".
- **31:**
  - It implies `req.text()` / `req.json()` exist on `IncomingMessage`; they do not.
  - "You cannot `setHeader` after `writeHead`" is imprecise.
- **21:** an Interview lens answer says "a reader ever sees"; it should be "only ever sees".
- **Outdated header and link text:**
  - Lessons 21–33 still have scraped header junk.
  - Their Learn More links point at `nodejs.org/api`, which now serves v26.
  - Lesson 73's header says "Topic 73 of 74", which is now out of date.
- **Bundled undici (not in any lesson):** `npm audit` flags undici 7.0.0–7.29.0 as high severity. That range includes the copy bundled in Node 24.19.0. Whether Node backported the fixes was not checked.

## Side effects outside the kit

- **Throwaway tools and downloaded docs:** `~/.cache/nodekit-repair-tools/pass3/`.
- **Unchanged:** the real npm prefix, `~/.npmrc`, shell rc files and git config.
- **Processes:** none left running.
